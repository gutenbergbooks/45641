<p class='c003'>This volume contains a few of many talks which
the author has given on Sunday afternoons to the
students of Bradford Academy. At their request
and for their convenience the volume is published.
While hundreds of addresses to young women of
college age have found their way into print, the
books that deal with the problems and needs of
younger girls and that look at life from their point
of view are few. Though these talks were inspired
by the needs of a definite group, the author will be
glad if the book finds a wider audience.</p>

<div>
  <h2 id='chI' class='c008'>I<br /> <br />NEW STARTS IN LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Life is full of opportunities for new beginnings.
Courage and hope go out of a person
only when he ceases to believe that for him
there is one more chance to retrieve the mistakes
of the past. George Eliot says, “It is
never too late to be what you might have
been.” Such a conviction is necessary if we
would live lives of power. There is a sonnet
by Senator Ingalls in which Opportunity is represented
as saying,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>“Soon or late</div>
      <div class='line'>I knock, unbidden, once at every gate!</div>
    <div class='c010'>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·</div>
      <div class='line'>... those who doubt or hesitate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Condemned to failure, penury, and woe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seek me in vain and uselessly implore.</div>
      <div class='line'>I answer not, and I return no more!“</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>One who saw life from a different point of
view<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> replied by a poem on the same subject
in which Opportunity says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“They do me wrong who say I come no more</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When once I knock and fail to find you in;</div>
      <div class='line'>For every day I stand outside your door</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And bid you wake, and rise to fight and win.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The latter view is surely the truer and more
inspiring one.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the person with the forward look and
genuine enthusiasm there are ever-recurring
opportunities for a fresh beginning. Indeed,
there ought to be no one for whom each day
does not commence the world anew. A well-known
woman, noted for the inspiring and
cheer-bringing quality of her life, used to say
upon awakening each morning, “Another great,
rich day!” There is no reason why every one
of us should not hail each returning morning in
this spirit.</p>

<p class='c011'>New Year’s Day is proverbially the time for
“turning over a new leaf.” The thought of the
clean, fresh pages of another year so soon to
be written upon has proved a stimulus and an
inspiration in many a life; and, in spite of all
the broken resolutions, the world is on the
whole much better because of a certain fresh
impulse to right living which this day always
brings.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nature has her New Year in the lovely
springtime, the time of budding leaf and blossoming
flower and nesting bird. Yet for us
human beings the real New Year’s Day of work
is neither the first of January nor the twenty-first
of March, but the early autumn. At that
time activities of all sorts that have been dormant
throughout the summer take on renewed
life. The stores and shops have a new air of
briskness and prosperity; churches that have
languished during the vacation season now settle
down to their wonted usefulness; benevolent
organizations open up their year’s campaign;
the great army of teachers and students return
to their work rested, freshened and recreated
by the long vacation and ready for new tasks.
There is a feeling of joy and strength in the
very air.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is possible at this time, for every student
and teacher, a very real “new start in
life.” I myself never get over a strange sense of
exhilaration as I realize that another volume of
the book of life has closed and that I am just
opening a new one. Never do I cease to be
strangely moved by the thought of the great
opportunity that is mine, the opportunity to
retrieve the mistakes of the past. Never do I
fail to be grateful for the privilege of leaving
behind me all the blunders and failures of former
years and of beginning life anew.</p>

<p class='c011'>The student who goes back to the school
where other years have been spent finds much
that is different. There are always some new
studies, and no two years ever see quite the
same combination of teachers and pupils.
Here, then, are opportunities which may be
fraught with momentous consequences. Some
fresh subject may awaken dormant powers,
some new teacher may call forth undreamed-of
possibilities, some friend not yet discovered
may add new meaning to life.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the greatest changes are likely to come to
the student who, for the first time, goes away
from home to school or college. Such an event
has been the turning-point in the lives of thousands
of men and women. From that time
date their most precious experiences. It was then
that they really began to live. Dull and spiritless,
indeed, must be the student who under
such circumstances does not feel his soul stirred
within him with wonder and with expectation. I
have always appreciated the feelings of a young
friend of mine, who was hardly able to close her
eyes in sleep the night before she went away to
school, so filled was she with joyful anticipation.</p>

<p class='c011'>In going away to school among strangers,
perhaps the most coveted opportunity you
have is the privilege of taking only your best
self with you. When we live and work with the
same people day after day and month after
month, they often get so used to us that they
do not recognize the springing-up of new desires
within us and the putting-forth of new
effort, but remember only the faults and failings
of the past. When we go away among
those who do not know us, however, our shortcomings
will never be discovered unless they
manifest themselves anew. Have you made
mistakes in the past? Have you blundered and
have you failed, not once, but over and over
again? Have you been selfish and inconsiderate
of the rights of others? Let no one guess from
your conduct now that such has ever been the
case. Have you been indolent, wasting your
time, and placing too high a value upon things
not worth while? Among strangers these faults
may be buried, never to come to life again.
You will be judged by what you are, not by
what you have been.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is well to cultivate the habit of mind which
lets the dead past bury its dead. This was St.
Paul’s attitude toward the things of the past.
“Forgetting the things which are behind, I
press forward.” There are, of course, many
memories of the past that one would never
wish to forget, memories of uplifting associations
and of victories over weaknesses that
give courage and strength for the future.
Along with these, however, there are memories
of mistakes and failures now irremediable but
which, though they cannot be effaced, can, in
a measure, be atoned for by the future. Constantly
to look backward with pain and regret
only paralyzes one’s energy. The fact that
much is expected of you for the future should
put you on your mettle and call forth your
highest powers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Your duties and obligations to yourself and
to others may, for the most part, be placed in
four classes. You have an intellectual life, a
moral and spiritual life, a social life, and a physical
life. Your problem will be to adjust to one
another the various claims upon you from these
different sources. This is not an easy task. It is
so difficult, that, because of inability to make
the adjustment, many make shipwreck of what
seemed to be a promising career. Indeed, he is
a wise person who at any age has his life so harmoniously
balanced that none of these different
claims unduly crowd the others. Most of us
are more or less one-sided. The best that we
can say is that we are working toward the goal
of perfect adjustment. Few reach it.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are in so-called “society,” for example,
thousands of women who have so emphasized
one side of their nature, the social, that all
other sides are dwarfed. Life is one constant
round of balls and dinners and social gayeties.
What ought to be the spice of life, or its dessert,
has become the main dish of the feast. So in
school and college there are always some who
make social pleasures the main issue, forgetting
all higher claims.</p>

<p class='c011'>We see the exaltation of the physical life in
the absurdly exaggerated emphasis placed upon
athletics in many of the colleges for men. The
tacit insistence upon the supreme importance
of these and kindred interests is one of the
reasons why scholarship in America is inferior
to that in some European countries. Though
athletic interests do not often encroach upon
scholarly work in our schools and colleges for
women, the same cannot be said of other activities,
such as dramatics and the manifold
phases of social life.</p>

<p class='c011'>One who cares only for the things of the
intellect may be a “clear, cold logic engine,” but he
is not of much use as a human being. Sympathy
and spiritual vision are beyond his ken.
The finer side of his nature remains undeveloped.
“He has become a machine,” as Emerson
declared, “a thinker, not a man thinking.”
The student who is merely a grind is not making
the best of his opportunities. In losing all
sides of student life but one, he is not even
becoming a scholar in any real sense.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is even possible to place too much emphasis
upon the moral and spiritual side of life.
This does not mean that one’s own moral
standards can be too high, nor does it mean
that there is anything else which can weigh for
a moment against character. It does mean,
however, that one has other obligations besides
that of being good. Many a person who
has walked the path of duty unflinchingly has
lived a narrow and unlovely life.</p>

<p class='c011'>It will be seen, then, that one of the most
difficult lessons the young student will have to
learn will be how much time and how much
emphasis to give to each of these various
provinces of student life.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are people who regard the physical
life as an end in itself and who live only for
it. Browning has the right view when he
says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To man, propose this test—</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy body at its best,</div>
      <div class='line'>How far can that project thy soul on its lone way?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The physical life always should be subordinated
to the mental and the spiritual life, yet
the body must command our respect because it
is the house in which the spirit dwells. “Know
ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
Ghost, which is in you?” One of your first
duties, then, is to take care of your health and
to make your body the efficient, ready instrument
of your will. You have no more important
duty, not only to self, but to others, than
to obey the laws of health, the most fundamental
of which pertain to exercise, sleep, rest,
and food. It is astonishing how few people,
especially how few women, there are who do
obey these simple laws, the importance of which
ought to be apparent to every one. Nature’s
disapproval of such disobedience is shown
promptly, and the penalty she inflicts is inexorable.
If ever I feel inclined to doubt the wisdom
of any of Nature’s ways—which I really
do not—it is when I see that girls, young, ignorant,
and inexperienced, have so important
a matter as their health given into their own
keeping, though their bad judgment or wilfulness
may have consequences so dire! Be willing
to deny yourself, to put forth effort, to pay
a very high price if need be, for a healthy body.</p>

<p class='c011'>The desire for social intercourse is natural
and right, and the person who shuns the society
of others is abnormal; yet social intercourse
probably offers, in one form or another, most
of the dangers which beset both young women
and young men while in school or college.
Those who fail ignominiously and are obliged
to withdraw, fail, not so often because of lack
of ability or insufficient preparation as because
they are swept off their feet by the multitude
of their new engagements and social activities.
The mind is full of a thousand other things and
study is deferred until a more convenient season,
which never comes. In the college, where
comparatively little supervision over students
is exercised, this has disastrous consequences,
though in the school, with its closer supervision,
the student is often saved from himself. It
seems hardly necessary to say that your friends
and your pleasures must not monopolize your
whole life. With the sensible student, work
comes first and pleasure afterward. One of the
greatest temptations, when you are surrounded
by pleasant friends, is to fritter time away.
Hours, days, months pass by and leave very
little that makes life permanently richer and
stronger. Sometimes, indeed, the personality
seems almost to disappear, merged in that of
others. I have known girls who were miserable
if they were left alone for half an hour. The
reason is that they have no resources within
themselves. They are parasites and derive
their sustenance entirely from others. Such a
life is not providing itself with the intellectual
and spiritual resources which we all need to have
at our command, and which should be gained in
youth or they are not likely to be gained at all.
Be friendly, be sociable, give your love freely,
but preserve your own individuality and independence.</p>

<p class='c011'>In no way do we reveal ourselves more surely
than in our choice of companions. Be slow
in choosing your nearest and dearest friends.
Many a girl has been very unhappy because
she rushed impetuously into a friendship from
which she afterward had to extricate herself at
the cost of great suffering both to herself and
to her friend. Take plenty of time in selecting
those who are to be your life friends, and
remember that here, as everywhere, “All is not
gold that glitters.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The intellectual life above all else distinguishes
man from the brute creation. Schools
and colleges exist chiefly for the purpose of
developing the intellectual life of the young,
though one sometimes meets students who
would admit the truth of that statement very
reluctantly if at all. A well-disciplined and
well-furnished mind is one of the chief satisfactions
of life. Changing fortune cannot take
from us our mental treasure. Its value never
diminishes, but increases, and never seems
greater than when other things upon which we
relied have been snatched from us. If we place
reliance upon money, it may take to itself
wings and fly away. We cannot be sure of
keeping health. Our friends may be taken
from us. Is it not the part of wisdom, in looking
forward and preparing for what one hopes
may be a successful and happy future, to ask
what are the “durable satisfactions” of life?
These should not be sacrificed for ephemeral
pleasures.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ability to focus a well-trained intelligence
upon any problem in hand is one for
which we should be willing to pay a high price.
Intellectual capacity and a cultivated mind
are not acquired without effort, and cannot be
secured by merely sitting through lectures or
recitations. The student who has a true sense
of values will plan her life in so systematic
and orderly a way that her use of time will be
determined by something more than present
inclination. You must remember that in order
to have <em>this</em>, you must give up <em>that</em>. One of the
hardest things for the inexperienced to learn is
that some very good things have to be sacrificed
in order that we may not miss better things.
All through life this is so, and there is no advantage
in deferring the time when it must be
learned. To your daily work, then, give your
best self, realizing that if you fail in that, you
will derive but little comfort from the fact that
you have had some success in other things.
Mental concentration and correct methods of
work should be the first lessons learned, and
they should be learned with thoroughness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lastly, we have a moral and spiritual nature.
One might have superb intellectual powers and
brilliant social gifts, yet if he lacked character,
these would bring him neither content nor success
in any large sense. Character is the foundation
upon which all success worthy the name
must rest. If the foundation be insecure, it
matters little how fine the superstructure.
When the writer of old said, “With all thy getting,
get wisdom,” he meant something more
than knowledge. Wisdom means insight into
life and into human nature. Still more, it implies
some comprehension of “the ways of God
with men,” that is, of the profound laws which
underlie the government of the moral and spiritual
universe. The greatest struggle of all, to
the student, should be the struggle for the ideal
life. In moral and spiritual stature, are you
small? Then it is your sacred duty to become
large. Where will there ever be a better opportunity
than under the ideal conditions that
surround you, with stimulating lessons, inspiring
teachers, understanding and appreciative
friends and leisure to use all of these for the
attainment of personal power?</p>

<p class='c011'>Remember that character is not something
that will take care of itself. You do not really
expect to acquire knowledge for which you do
not work. You admit that if you would have
intellectual capacity you must study and train
the mind. Yet it is hard for you to comprehend
that you have anything to do with the development
of your own character. Do not believe
that honor, courage, generosity and courtesy
come by chance.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is this to be said, however, about the
development of character. It is, to use Woodrow
Wilson’s phrase, “a by-product.” As he
says, it comes whether you will or not as a consequence
of a life devoted to duty. You do not
deliberately say, “I will improve my character.”
What you do say is, “I will do the duty
that plainly lies before me. I will not shirk it.
I will not defer it.” In this way, and perhaps
only in this way, does character grow.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is no royal road to high character any
more than there is to learning. Indeed, there
is no royal road to anything worth while.
“What wouldst thou?” says the old proverb;
“Pay for it and take it.” Character is formed
from within, by the efforts and strivings and
aspirations of the individual. The will is made
strong by choosing the right, not by having the
right thrust upon it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Who can tell what momentous changes are
to be wrought in your life by going away to
school? The windows of your soul will be
opened in a hundred new directions. You will
learn, or you ought to learn, what things are
most worth while. There is so much more in
life than you ever dreamed there was, so much
more of interest and beauty and abiding charm!
This means that even if you do your best there
will be time for you to master only a little of
that knowledge which attracts its devotees and
forever beckons them on. Life is too short
either to know or to do but a fraction of all that
every earnest person longs to know and to do.
Until we reach this view of things we can have
no sense of the true value of time. As soon as
we do reach it, as soon as we grasp something
of the real worth of life, we cannot waste time,
for time is the stuff of which life is made.</p>

  <h2 id='chII' class='c015'>II<br /> <br />SCHOOL FRIENDSHIPS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Send a boy to college,” says Emerson,
“and his fellows educate him”; and Edward
Everett Hale has said that the best part of the
education one gets at college is that which his
fellow students give him. I have always felt
sorry for those unfortunate children whose
solitary education is obtained with tutors or
governesses rather than in schools with other
boys and girls. While not disparaging the influence
of the teacher, which I well know from
personal experience may be a transforming
and vitalizing power in a young life, I yet believe
it to be true that the standards of most
young people and their ways of looking at life
are determined chiefly by the companions and
intimate associates of their own age.</p>

<p class='c011'>During certain periods of development, at
any rate, the youth is shaped by the opinions
and ideals of the world of his own contemporaries,
rather than, as we teachers and parents
sometimes fondly imagine, by the ideals imposed
upon him from our world. We who have
passed beyond that stage can recall how truly
we lived and moved and had our being in that
world, with its standards which now, perhaps,
seem to us somewhat unreal. In matters of
dress, speech, and deportment how much less
we cared for the opinion of our elders than for
the approval of our group or “set” of friends!
This period of life may be soon outgrown, but
while it lasts there are tremendous forces at
work upon the young life, and their potency
for good or evil is often underestimated.</p>

<p class='c011'>Chief among these forces for good is a good
friendship. The real meaning of unselfishness
has many a time been learned first through a
strong friendship. Love is essentially self-forgetful.
Only he who has learned to love has
learned to live. Nothing more surely calls out
the best in one and compels one to do his best
than an ennobling friendship. Such friendships,
then, should be encouraged and young
people should have abundant opportunity for
forming them. One of the many advantages a
fine school offers over even the best private instruction
is the rich opportunity for congenial
friendships. Like attracts like, and the finest
spirits in the school will be your friends if you
have that within you which draws them and
can hold them. What you are to be during all
the remainder of your life will be determined
largely by the friends chosen now, for they will
help to give your nature its bent, from which
it is not likely to depart. Afterward, looking
back, you will not be able to comprehend how
life could have been lived at all if you had
never met certain persons who have become a
part of your very existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not only in youth that friendship is one
of the chief blessings of life. It has been regarded
by the choicest spirits of every age as
among the best gifts of the gods to men. Open
any book of “familiar quotations” and you
may read the tributes that have been paid to
friendship by the great poets, from Bible times
to the present. It has generally been believed,
however, that youth is the time when the most
transforming and most enduring friendships
are made. This is, doubtless, because later in
life we are likely to become engrossed with our
own affairs, the cares of life press upon us, character
becomes fixed, and the outgoing of self
demanded in a true friendship becomes increasingly
difficult. Yet, though youth is the ideal
time for the formation of lasting friendships,
the great lack, at this period of life, is a true
sense of values. We do not enjoy our friendships
to their full because we do not realize
their worth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Youth is wasteful of many things, but perhaps
of nothing more than of friendship. Too
many people wake up later in life to find that
what has been so thoughtlessly thrown away
never can be regained. The privilege of having
a friend and the privilege of being a friend are
among the greatest blessings this world affords.
To discover in middle life that the friends of
one’s youth have, one by one, fallen away, because
one made no effort to keep them, will be
a sad awakening.</p>

<p class='c011'>We all have our own conception of friendship,
based upon our own experiences; thus to
no two persons does the term mean exactly the
same. To some the content of the word grows
richer and deeper as life goes on, while with
others the reverse is true. The cynic believes
there is no such thing as true friendship, yet
the cynic once was young and probably not a
stranger to the transforming power of friendship.
What we are to believe about friendship,
then, depends upon our own character and upon
the kind of life we live.</p>

<p class='c011'>It takes ideal people to form an ideal
friendship; therefore there are not many such friendships.
Erring human beings that we are, we
carry our frailties into every relation of life.
“I am of opinion,” says Cicero, “that except
among the virtuous, friendship cannot exist.”
Have you a real friend? While it is true that
the friendship between you may not be an ideal
one, it is also true that through it you and your
friend are both having a rare opportunity to
grow toward your ideal and in this way to
make your friendship perfect. Would you rid
yourself of egregious faults? There are two instead
of one to grapple with each fault. Would
you march on to the attainment of more splendid
virtues? There are two instead of one to
struggle and to win the victory.</p>

<p class='c011'>How to make friends perhaps no one can tell
you, since friends are born, not made. We
choose our pleasures, our books, our occupations,
but we do not choose our friends. We
only discover them. The formation of a friendship
is an unconscious process and must be so.
There can be nothing deliberate and premeditated
about it. Why is it that one sees the best
in you and another the worst? Why does one
understand before you speak while another
cannot understand even after you explain? If
we could answer these questions we should be
able to reduce friendship to a mathematical
formula, which no one wishes to do. The
mystery of it is one of its charms. One can only
say as did Montaigne about his friend, “If a
man should importune me to give a reason why
I loved him I can only answer, because it was he,
because it was I.” Some people attract us by
a certain intuition of character. If the intuition
be true and if there be adaptability and
community of interests, a foundation exists
for a close and enduring friendship.</p>

<p class='c011'>The basis for friendship is personality. You
have nothing to give your friend but yourself.
You should, therefore, make heavy demands
upon yourself. Can you offer your friend anything
less than a constantly enriching life?
Good intentions are not enough; there must be
performance. You have probably asked yourself
many times whether you deserve this high
friendship. Perhaps you do not. Then resolve
that you sometime will deserve it. You are
interesting to your friend now. What can you
do that you may be more so to-morrow?</p>

<p class='c011'>Those who lack the power of making friends—and
there are unfortunately many such—have
one of two failings, or both. Often they
are not sincere. The insincere person cannot
be a true friend and may not have a true
friend. We demand that our friends shall
“ring true.” A much more common fault
than insincerity is selfishness. One may be not
positively and actively selfish but self-centered.
The self-centered person does not know how
to enter sympathetically into the feelings of
others. Such persons should earnestly strive
to share the joys and sorrows of those about
them and to make the experiences of others
their own. Sometimes we say of a person,
“He has a genius for making friends.” Such
persons have in an eminent degree the capacity
for carrying close to their hearts the interests
of others. Remember that unless you really
care about the concerns and the welfare of
others, there is no possible way to make them
believe you do.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is worth while to cultivate the art of making
friends, or, rather, it is worth while to put
forth every effort to make one’s self worthy of
having friends. He who said that a friend
“doubles our joys and halves our sorrows”
might have expressed it even more strongly.
The author of the Book of Ecclesiastes understood
this when he wrote, “Two are better
than one; because they have a good reward for
their labour. For if they fall, the one will lift up
his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he
falleth; for he hath not another to help him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>You owe your friend, first of all, integrity
of character and sincerity in all your dealings.
With your friend you can be yourself, your real
self. Any pretense, any deceit, any concealment
of vital things will create a barrier that
nothing can ever break down. You may or you
may not admit your friend to the inmost recesses
of your heart, but so far as you do admit
her, there must be straightforward honesty.
Integrity includes not only our dealings with
our friends, it affects all our relations with
others. The oft-quoted couplet from Lovelace
expresses a truth which it behooves every one
to take to heart who would be or would have
a friend:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I could not love thee, dear, so much</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Loved I not honour more.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>No real friendship can exist without loyalty
on both sides. It is the place of a friend to look
after the interests of her friend as if they were
her own. Much inspiration may be gained
from studying the great friendships of history,
such as that of David and Jonathan, of Ruth
and Naomi, or of Tennyson and Hallam. Does
your friendship in comparison with any one
of these seem insignificant, even puerile? Then
use the greatest friendship of which you know
as a touchstone by which to test your own. For
a real friend to speak an unkind word about an
absent friend is unthinkable. To envy her, or
to desire precedence over her in any way, is
proof that your love for her is not real, but only
assumed. How far should loyalty go? We all
remember the answer of Christ when asked,
“How often should I forgive my brother, until
seven times?” His answer, until “seventy
times seven,” means, as we all know, that there
should be no limit to one’s forgiveness. In the
same way, there should be no limit to your loyalty
to your friend. It should be bounded only
by her need and your power.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, there should be community of
interests and mutual trust and self-revelation.
You have friends whom you admit only to the
outer citadel of your heart. Some are “good
company” and you love to share your pleasures
with them, but in your serious moments you
turn away from them. Others share your work,
or some special interest in your life. But with
your real friend you share the deepest things of
your existence. She understands you in your
highest moments, she respects your ideals and
shares them, she comprehends the fundamental
purpose of your life. Only friends who can
share each other’s best selves know the highest
friendship.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have said that there must be mutual self-revelation.
Never make the mistake of urging
the confidence of your friend. Do not force any
doors. If you have not the key that unlocks her
heart, try to find it by making yourself worthy.
Self-giving must be voluntary or it is in vain.
We elicit from others only that which we have
the power to make our own. Mutual trust
would forever banish all petty jealousy. Your
friend is not accountable to you for all her doings,
and for you to act as if she were will only
estrange her from you. Life is too rich in opportunity
for her to be limited by any one relationship.
If your friend’s life is to expand, her
claims upon others and theirs upon her must be
recognized.</p>

<p class='c011'>If your friendship is a worthy one, you are
constantly gaining in patience, in courtesy, and
in self-control, for love is the greatest of all
teachers. Do you promptly check each impatient
word that springs to your lips? Do you
show the friend who so easily overlooks your
faults the same fine courtesy that you show to
the stranger who would not overlook them?
What a strange idea we sometimes have that
love gives us the privilege of rudeness! Your
friend may love you in spite of an occasional fit
of ill-temper, but no one ever loved another
better for it. To be exacting, domineering, or
selfish may not drive your friend completely
away from you, but it will not strengthen the
tie that binds your hearts together.</p>

<p class='c011'>There should be a certain equality between
friends. I do not mean that love is not able easily
to bridge over many kinds of inequalities,
as that of a difference in station in life or in age,
or even in education. I mean that a friendship
is harmful when one of the friends is a parasite,
receiving everything and contributing
nothing. Self-respect demands that each shall
give as well as receive.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his essay on “Friendship,” Emerson says
no truer word than this: “Your friend is he who
makes you do what you can.” One must not
be a fault-finder or a thorn in the flesh of one’s
friends, yet friendship has no more sacred duty
than to point out faults by showing the better
way. “He who truly loves is irreconcilable to
faults in one whom he loves; they blur the
vision which always lies in his soul.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On the other hand, it is especially the office
of a friend to recognize the excellencies of his
friend. “Your friend is he who tells you of
your virtues and who insists upon them most
when you are most inclined to doubt their existence.”
Who of us is not at times sorely in
need of this kindly office of a friend? In our
moments of discouragement, when faith in self
is at a low ebb, the true friend comes to us and
by his faith in us restores the balance of life.
And what a comfort then is that belief in us and
in our powers and possibilities! Friends who
do not perform this office, each for the other, as
often as the opportunity arises, have missed
much of the blessedness of true friendship!</p>

<p class='c011'>Those who love know that love is not blind.
Love has the truest sight. If you want to know
what a person really is, do not ask one who
hates him, but one who loves him. Yet love
may blind itself. To shut your eyes to the
faults of your friend is not the way to lessen
those faults. To stand between her and the
penalty which her deeds have justly brought
upon her is to deprive her of one of the most
important means of growth. If your affection
is of a poor and narrow sort, you will constantly
urge your friend to consult her own pleasure and
interests in preference to those of others, in this
way stifling in her every altruistic impulse.
Acting and reacting upon each other in this
way you will find that generous feeling and
disinterested affection in both of you will constantly
diminish. Any two people who love
each other should cherish, each in the other,
the spirit of self-forgetful service.</p>

<p class='c011'>A friendship, like everything else in life, is
known by its fruits. “Men do not gather
grapes of thorns nor figs from thistles.” The
fruits of a worthy friendship are higher and
ever higher ideals of life and duty. If your
friendship has made you less sensitive to other
obligations and less responsive to the call of
duty, beware of it! If your love for one has
lessened your affection for your other friends,
it is not a good friendship. Friendship should
expand the heart, not contract it. Everything
savoring of narrowness and exclusiveness is a
hindrance. You must love your friend so much
that you love the whole world better because
of her. You must respect and reverence her
so truly that all human nature is dignified and
ennobled through her.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All things through thee take nobler form</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And look beyond the earth;</div>
      <div class='line'>The mill-round of our fate appears</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A sun-path in thy worth.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>What is the place of the emotional element in
friendship? Not the chief place, it may be confidently
asserted. In the richest and most enduring
friendships, other things are of more
importance. Not that there is an absence of
emotion—far from it. The danger, however, of
over-emphasizing emotion is that the friendship
may descend to mere sentimentality. What is
more important than emotion in friendship, do
you ask? The unity of spirit that gradually
takes place in a fine friendship; the feeling that
each is perfectly understood by the other; and
the knowledge that each can depend upon the
other’s loyalty in any and every emergency of
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>It usually takes years to learn how to <em>be</em> a
true friend and often some hard experiences are
necessary to teach us to appreciate our friends.
Sometimes we look back upon the wasted years,
and, thinking how rich and happy they might
have been, we cry out, “If I had only known!”
And sometimes, alas! our friends have to be
taken from us ere we learn their worth. Then,
as we sit alone with our thoughts, with what a
heartache do we remember our every failure to
measure up to the stature of the perfect friend!</p>

<p class='c011'>If you would be a true friend and if you
would appreciate your friends now, without
waiting for costly lessons, ask yourself some
searching questions. Do you care more about
what you can get out of your friendship or
about what you can put into it? Do you think
more about being served or about serving? Do
you wonder whether your friend loves you
enough or whether you cannot love her more?
Do you never imagine yourself slighted or neglected
or misunderstood? If you can answer
these questions as they ought to be answered,
you are on the way to a perfect friendship.
Phillips Brooks, who was famous for his friendships,
wrote, “Surely there is no more beautiful
sight to see in all this world than the growth of
two friends’ natures, who, as they grow old together,
are always fathoming with newer needs
deeper depths of each other’s life and opening
richer views of one another’s helpfulness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Does friendship cost anything? Yes. All the
best things in the world cost something and
only they can have them who are willing to pay
the price. In its highest and most enduring
form friendship belongs, as I have said, only to
the highest and finest natures. So much does
it cost that no others will—perhaps no others
can—pay the price. What is the price? That
is the point—one never knows the cost in advance.
Whatever the price, however, the true
friend is ready to pay it. No sacrifice is too
great to make for a real friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, sad to say, many a friendship makes
shipwreck even though no heroic, sublimely
self-sacrificing deeds were demanded of either
of the parties to it. The things that would
have kept it alive were so little, so easy, but
they were too much! After your school days
are over and you and your friend have gone
your separate ways, it will take time to write
those weekly letters. Will your friendship be
worth enough to you to pay that price? And
by and by, when new interests have come into
your life, it will be even less easy to perform
those offices of friendship which must not be
neglected if friends are to continue to have any
share in each other’s lives. To keep up the
pretty customs of old—to send the birthday
gift, the Christmas remembrance, the occasional
message of warm and unchanging love—all
these things take time in such a busy world!
And so “the little rift within the lute” appears,
which, ever widening, will slowly silence all. It
is not a cheerful story, but it is the history
of many a friendship which had believed itself
eternal. Some of our early friendships we outgrow,
and it is best that we should. It is part
of “putting away childish things.” But if we
realized what we were doing, it is inconceivable
that we should ever depart so far from the
dreams of our youth as to let any true friendship
go.</p>

<p class='c011'>Unless you are very watchful and loving,
then, the old friends will, one by one, drop out
of your life and make no sign. I beg that you
will see to it that there is at least a handful
of them left. They should be the real ones,
who genuinely loved you and always will.
“Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel.”
Never let them go. Let no changing tides of
fortune sweep them from you. Be very patient
with them as you expect them to be with you.
Make allowances for the innumerable appearances
of neglect, saying to yourself that they
are only appearances. Friends who bear and
forbear with each other in this way will find
that the friendship grows deeper and stronger
with each succeeding year.</p>

<p class='c011'>If you really want to be such a friend as I
have described, I can think of nothing that
will help you more than to read over often the
thirteenth chapter of St. Paul’s first Epistle
to the Corinthians, that matchless chapter on
<em>love</em>, and to try to make your affection as near
as possible like that which he describes. Nowhere
else, in the Bible or out of it, have we
so clear, so true, so moving a description of
love. Just to read it over brings a glow to the
heart and a kindlier feeling toward the whole
human race. Let the love that you give to your
friends be the love that suffereth long and is
kind; that envieth not, that seeketh not its own,
is not easily provoked; that beareth all things,
believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
all things; above all, that <em>never faileth</em>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c015'>III<br /> <br />THE ART OF LIVING WITH OTHERS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You may not think living with others is an
art, but it is one of the finest and most difficult
of arts. By learning it early in life we save ourselves
many unpleasant experiences. If we are
difficult to live with, our punishment is severe
and inexorable. No one will live with us who
can escape from us. We all know people who,
upon entering a room, bring with them a cloud.
On the other hand, we also know those whose
coming always brings sunshine. Some one said
of a young friend of mine of unusually radiant
personality, “When she went down the corridor
it seemed as if a light had passed by.” A Boston
daily paper once had this item: “Yesterday
was dark and rainy, but Phillips Brooks passed
down Newspaper Row and the sun shone.” It
goes without saying that these persons were
good to live with.</p>

<p class='c011'>One may be honest, sincere, generous, and,
in the main, kind, and yet be difficult to live
with because of the absence of the so-called
lesser virtues. We must have the elemental
virtues as foundations of character, but they
are not enough. As a Bible writer puts it, it
is “the little foxes that spoil the vineyards.”
The “little foxes” are the little faults which
arise within us almost unnoticed, and which
grow upon us with added years. Some of these
faults cause people to want to avoid us and
seek the company of those who are pleasanter
to have about. To want to be liked is a laudable
desire when one does not sacrifice anything
higher for it. To aim to be a person whose
presence brings gladness to others is not only
your right, but your duty. There is a cheap
popularity which those who seek it are willing
to purchase at any cost. That is not what I
am talking about. I will name some of the
little faults which often spoil an otherwise
admirable character.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Unnecessary criticism of others.</em> I say <em>unnecessary</em>
criticism. All honor and praise to the one
who can speak the word of admonishment or
reproof when it ought to be spoken and in the
right spirit and the right manner; who can give
warning or suggestion at the proper time and
place and in a tactful way. We all need more
friends who are not afraid to tell us of our
faults with the high motive of aiding us to
overcome them; who will even run the risk of
losing our friendship in order that they may
help us to be true to our best selves. But how
much of the fault-finding in the world does any
good or is intended to do any good? Is it not
true that much of it merely gives vent to irritability
on the part of the fault-finder? The
next time you are tempted to find fault, ask
yourself two questions: First, will it do any
good? Next, am I doing it in the right spirit?
Unless these two questions can be answered in
the affirmative, then silence is golden. Moreover,
criticism should, whenever possible, be
tempered with praise. We can take much from
one who recognizes the good in us and who
knows that our virtues far outweigh our failings.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another of the little foxes is <em>fretfulness</em>,
<em>grumbling</em>, <em>nagging</em>, call it what you will. We
all recognize it when we come in contact with
it and probably we have been shocked at times
to discover it in ourselves. This fault grows
rapidly in the atmosphere of loving tolerance.
It never would have an opportunity to develop
in us if we were not surrounded by those
who love us, make excuses for us, and put up
with us. Strangers would not submit to it
and we should not think of asking them to do
so. It is a subtle danger, that creeps on us so
stealthily that often we are not aware of its
approach. It may come at first from some disordered
physical state. The happy, healthy
child does not whine, the ailing child usually
does; too often this is the beginning of an irritability
that pursues its victim through life.</p>

<p class='c011'>We Americans are a nervous, excitable people,
partly, perhaps, because of climatic conditions.
A stimulating climate fosters a tendency
to disorders of the nervous system. We
should, therefore, be on our guard against this
type of sin that doth so easily beset us. Our
physical condition is usually more within our
control than we are willing to admit. The girl
who keeps late hours, takes little exercise, and
eats injudiciously is morally responsible for
her irritable condition, for the remedy is in
her own hands. Can you not remember some
time when you retired at night feeling ill-used
and unappreciated, filled with the thought that
life was full of trials and crosses and that your
lot was particularly unhappy—only to wake
up the next morning in a glorious world where
your condition in life seemed a very fortunate
one? It is not necessary to adduce arguments
to prove that one of your first duties is to keep
yourself every day and every hour of your life
in the best possible physical condition. You
can conquer only by making it a matter of
conscience. Alternating work and rest, sufficient
recreation and amusement, and always
some change after prolonged labor are necessary
to keep one in good physical condition.
As a result, you find yourself in possession
of a serenity and a self-control which forbid
irritability.</p>

<p class='c011'>Have you a quick, hot <em>temper</em>? You cannot
live amicably with others until you have
learned to control it. A display of temper is
the flash of lightning, the burst of flame. It
is all over in an instant, yet, in a fit of temper
what may one not say or do? He is “beside
himself,” we say—that is, he is no longer
himself, but some one else outside of himself.
Have you ever, in a burst of temper, wounded
those you love best in all the world? Have
you said or done things that you feared had
lost you the respect of some one whose good
opinion was of priceless value to you? Have
you given utterance to words that you would
give years of your life to recall? If so, worse,
almost, than anything else, is the fact that you
have lost your own self-respect. What is more
undignified, more ridiculous than one who has
lost control of himself and is saying and doing
things to-day of which he will bitterly repent
to-morrow? Remember that nothing can more
easily cost you the respect of others than a display
of temper. Thereafter you are marked as
one who lacks balance, dignity, power.</p>

      <div class='line'>“If wishing could bring them back,</div>
      <div class='line'>If wishing could bring them back—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The wrathful words that flew away</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To mar the joy of another’s day—</div>
      <div class='line'>If wishing could bring them back!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But wishing cannot bring them back, as we
all know to our cost. The only thing to do is to
learn our lesson and in the future to keep the
mastery of self. “He that ruleth his spirit is
better than he that taketh a city.”</p>

<p class='c011'>If you have a quick temper, do not bemoan
the fact, but be thankful. It probably means
that you have spirit, enthusiasm, power to
do things, the achieving will. Do not ask to
change places with the sluggish person who
lacks the capacity to feel keenly and to dare
greatly. Rather, learn to control your temper
instead of letting it control you. We do
not admire a person who cannot get angry.</p>

<p class='c011'>In reading the biography of a great man recently,
I found these words: “He had the power
of a great wrath.” Is it not true that all people
who have accomplished large things have had
this power? George Washington was seldom
angry, yet, when his righteous indignation was
roused, it was like a consuming fire. We all
remember the story of Abraham Lincoln, who,
when only a young man, seeing some slaves
auctioned off in the New Orleans slave market,
declared, “If I ever get a chance to hit that
thing I will hit it hard!” And he did hit it hard.
St. Paul says, “Be ye angry and sin not.”
Christ himself more than once showed the
power of a great indignation, as witness the occasion
when he drove the money-changers out
of the temple with a whip of cords. There are
wrongs being done that should cause your
blood to boil with indignation, and you will
be not less but more capable of feeling and
expressing your wrath at wrong-doing if you
control yourself when small things cross you.</p>

<p class='c011'>The acquirement of self-control is not so
difficult as it seems. All you need to do is to
make it a habit. If you only knew it, some of
the calmest, serenest, most self-controlled persons
of your acquaintance were once
conspicuous for a high temper. “What man has done
man can do.”</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Self-will</em> is a fault which spoils many friendships
and is an element of discord in many
families. It is a determination to have one’s
own way. If one is persistent and disagreeable
enough about it, one always succeeds in getting
it, for others will not think the matter of sufficient
importance continually to oppose. When
we have this quality in youth, by middle age
people are saying of us, “He is set in his ways,
he is domineering, autocratic.” This tendency
often shows itself in a determination to have
the last word. Who has not at some time been
in a family where heated discussions were continually
arising out of some trifle? One says
the thing in question happened Monday and
another insists it was Thursday, until finally
every one has forgotten what was the real subject
of discussion. In the intercourse between
you and your friend, is there one whose will
prevails in every case of disagreement? Then
beware. That way lies danger for both. In
your family is there one who determines every
plan and settles every course of action? Some
one is in danger of becoming a despot.</p>

<p class='c011'>If we would be good to live with we must not
be too <em>exacting</em>. We all have the “defects of our
qualities,” and this fault is one that often characterizes
the person of very high ideals. We
ought to be dissatisfied with ourselves. A passion
for perfection should forever forbid any
self-complacency. We ought also to demand
the best of others so far as we may. But how
far have we a right to hold them to the same
standards as ourselves? We do not know the
springs of action in their lives, “the moving
why they do it.” Do not give your friends the
uncomfortable feeling that you are continually
disappointed in them. Good sense, sympathy,
and tact are necessary if we would act the rôle
of mentor to those about us.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <em>intolerant</em> person is hard to live with.
By intolerance I mean the inability to get
another person’s point of view. We are prone
to demand that others look through our own
glasses; we think that any other point of view
than ours is wrong. Young people are said to
be, on the whole, intolerant. The tolerant
spirit we often acquire as we grow older. If you
are serious-minded, do not think all lively people
frivolous. If you are gay, remember that
not all serious persons are stupid. When you
respect others, respect their opinions and try
to see the reason for them. We need more of
that kind of trust in each other. Not all the
good people are in your church nor are all the
honest men in your father’s political party.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Discourtesy</em> is one of the enemies of friendly
intercourse. By this I mean all that is not gentle,
kindly, and refined. Rudeness kills affection
almost as readily as does unfaithfulness.
We should not neglect with our nearest and
dearest those refinements and amenities which
we instinctively practice with strangers, and
which oil the machinery of life and make it run
smoothly. Do you say, “But I must be myself
in my own home. I must speak as I please and
act as I feel”? Not if to be yourself is to act
the churl; not if it is to blurt out every unkind
thought that may come to your mind. Home is
the place for dressing-gown and slippers, not
for boorishness. It is a great thing to be able to
win friends, but greater to be able to keep them.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As similarity of mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or something not to be defined</div>
      <div class='line in2'>First fixes our attention,</div>
      <div class='line'>So manners decent and polite,</div>
      <div class='line'>The same we practiced at first sight,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Will save it from declension.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Finally, no <em>selfish</em> person is good to live with.
Selfishness in one form or another is at the root
of most of the evil in the world. It is an insidious
foe, and there are none of us whom it does
not attack. It is in the home that habits of unselfishness
must be developed or they are likely
never to be developed at all. In the home there
is an opportunity to practice unselfishness
every day and every hour. Nowhere else are
there so many opportunities to be watchful of
the needs of others and to be ready to supply
them. Nowhere else are the occasions so manifold
in which one may surrender one’s own
pleasure for the good of others. Yet, wherever
people live together, there is constant opportunity
for the practice of this virtue.</p>

<p class='c011'>These are some of the little foxes that spoil
the vines. There have been people who have
been exacting, fault-finding, irritable, self-willed,
and discourteous, who yet have lived
honest lives and have accomplished something
of good in the world. Yet the good accomplished
would have been far greater and their
lives would have been much happier if, to the
more fundamental virtues, there had been
added the fine flowering of character which
comes with the addition of those particular
qualities which make one comfortable to live
with, a pleasant person to have about.</p>

  <h2 id='chIV' class='c015'>IV<br /> <br />ENDURING HARDNESS<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In the beautiful cathedral in Oxford there
is a stained-glass window, each pane of which
represents certain well-known characters in the
Bible. Upon my first visit to the cathedral one
of these windows immediately attracted my
attention, and I never visited the place afterward
without finding my eyes wandering to
that spot. The picture is of the child Timothy,
kneeling by the side of his mother, who is
teaching him. In its child-purity and wistfulness,
the boy Timothy reminds one of the
“Infant Samuel” by Sir Joshua Reynolds.</p>

<p class='c011'>Timothy, as you know, was a young friend
of St. Paul’s, and the two epistles in the New
Testament called by his name were letters
which St. Paul wrote to the young man, whom
he loved as a son, and whom, indeed, again and
again he calls his son.</p>

<p class='c011'>St. Paul was a man who won to a remarkable
degree the admiration and love of those with
whom he lived and worked. He seems to have
been almost without kindred in the years when
we know him, going about from place to place
and establishing churches, then leaving them
to the care of others. But, though without a
home of his own or family ties, he finds himself
at home and among dear friends wherever he
goes. Few men have ever been so loved. He
always made a place for himself in the hearts
of the people with whom he worked. This was
particularly true of the young men about him,
and we have many touching passages showing
his affection for them and theirs for him. He
says he yearns to see them, he longs for their
welfare, he prays for them without ceasing, and
he sends these young men out filled with his
spirit, to carry on his work. Of these young
men, Timothy seems to have been the one he
loved best. He sent him to be the head of some
of the churches as a sort of bishop, and the two
letters which we have from St. Paul to him are
letters of advice regarding the management of
the churches. They emphasize above all things
the importance of personal character. Timothy,
as we learn from these letters of St. Paul,
had been brought up most religiously by his
mother, Lois, and his grandmother, Eunice,
who seem to have been two of Paul’s dearest
friends and co-workers. “From a child thou
hast known the scriptures, which are able to
make thee wise unto salvation,” said St. Paul
to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Study to show thyself approved unto God,
a workman that needeth not to be ashamed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou, therefore, endure hardness, as a good
soldier of Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The letter from which these sentences are
taken, the second Epistle to Timothy, is supposed
to be the last letter Paul ever wrote. It
was written under peculiarly solemn circumstances
and contains the deep, heartfelt advice
of an old man to a young man whom he loves
as his own child. It is a sad letter, because Paul
is in prison and he knows that his end is near.
He believes that he will soon be put to death,
and we know that his premonition proved true.
In the last letter which he was ever to pen he
speaks of the things which he most desires for
his beloved Timothy. I think we shall be impressed
with the fact that he omits the gifts
that most people wish for those whom they love,
and asks for some others upon which the world
has not been prone to set high value.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fathers toil that they may give their children
wealth and all that it will buy. They slave in
offices, wear out their health, and give up most
of the refining and elevating influences of life.
And the children squander as fast as they can
the money that has come to them so easily, in
ways that only do them harm; in ways that take
energy and will and purpose out of them; or
rather, that never give these virtues an opportunity
to develop. A few years ago much attention
was directed to an epigrammatic remark
of Mr. Roosevelt’s in regard to the American
multi-millionaire, “whose son is a fool and
whose daughter a foreign princess.” The gratification
of every want without effort on the
part of the individual must breed selfishness
and a whole train of attendant evils. Indeed,
many young people whose parents are far
from wealthy grow up with utterly selfish ideas
about money and little knowledge of its true
use and value.</p>

<p class='c011'>I might speak of many more things which
indulgent parents often wish for their children,
but perhaps they may all be summed up in one
phrase—<em>easy lives</em>. They want no rough winds
to blow on their beloved ones; for them no
dusty roads, or stony paths, or rugged heights
to climb. They must walk in sunshine on beds
of flowers. For the children of others the toil,
the hardship, the suffering; for their own a life
of luxurious ease.</p>

<p class='c011'>But what gift or blessing does St. Paul ask
for the young man so dear to him? An easy,
luxurious life? How the great apostle would
have scorned such a thought! Instead he asks
that the youth may learn how to <em>endure hardness</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hardness” in our lives is not likely to be
mainly physical hardship, perhaps not that at
all, though this kind of endurance was one of
the elements that contributed to St. Paul’s
greatness. He tells us that he had been beaten
with rods, that he had been stoned, had suffered
shipwreck, cold, hunger, and nakedness.
Nothing daunted him, no obstacle was to him
insurmountable, he feared naught, even death
itself. The greatness of his work is due to his
remarkable physical endurance as well as to his
superb moral courage. In comparison with him
how weak and useless must even the best of us
seem to ourselves! Though we may never be
called upon to endure dangers or privations,
can we not see what a splendid thing it is, this
independence of physical comfort, this fearlessness,
this dependence upon inward resources
rather than upon outward support? And yet
how many people we know whose day is spoiled
if the morning meal is not to their taste, whose
spirits sink with cloudy weather, whose physical
comfort or discomfort largely governs disposition
and conduct! Surely a quality which it is
worth the while of young people to cultivate
is physical “hardness”—ability to endure discomfort,
indifference to luxury and ease, independence
of outward conditions.</p>

<p class='c011'>But for most of us there is another kind of
“enduring hardness” which is even more important.
It is learning to do without the things
we cannot or ought not to have, whatever they
may be, and to derive happiness from the things
which we can have. It is learning to do as a
matter of course the difficult and the disagreeable
things that ought to be done. There is not
one of us who does not long for some unattainable
thing. Yet if it is not for us, we should turn
to what we have, or can have, and make the
best of that.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suppose that circumstances refuse to allow
you to surround yourself with the friends you
love best or to live after the manner that would
most please you,—and this will happen to
many after school days are over,—what is
there left but to make the very most of the
friends whose companionship you have and to
find the best in the circumstances which surround
you? And if you cannot choose the kind
of life you dream would be best for you, in the
place where you feel that you could be happiest,
remember that success or failure in life for you
will depend upon your power to adapt yourself
to your environment and to draw forth, from
every inevitable combination of circumstances,
new material for growth. This is, in a very high
sense, “enduring hardness.” Suppose you have
been making cherished plans for the future and
all at once they are torn to shreds. What then?
Can you pick up the threads of your life, change
the pattern, but still weave something beautiful
with them? And can you do it—not with cold
and stoic fortitude, but cheerfully and serenely?
If so, that is “enduring hardness” in the same
spirit in which St. Paul endured it.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is well for us sometimes to imagine ourselves
stripped of all these external props to
happiness, such as money, position, and influential
friends, and to ask ourselves what kind
of a life we could make without them. It is
then that we find out what we are really worth.
We all believe—though we usually act as if we
did not believe it—that to build up a strong
and noble character is the chief end and aim of
life. But how seldom, unless forced by circumstance,
do we give ourselves the opportunity of
acquiring those virtues which more than any
others make for high character! Nothing is so
good for the development of character as struggle,
suffering, <em>hardness</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>I remember a letter that I received recently
from a young woman of my acquaintance. The
only daughter of wealthy parents, she had enjoyed
every advantage and comfort of life and
she knew that it was likely she would continue
to have them. This very fact gave her
anxiety, and she wrote, “What can we, who are
born to luxury, do to offset the lack of struggle?”
She did well to be anxious. There must
be something to counterbalance this lack, yet
how few who are born to wealth realize it!</p>

<p class='c011'>I often say to myself, as I think of some
aimless, indolent, yet really able girl, “What a
blessing it would be if she were thrown upon her
own resources and forced to earn her own living!”
Of another, too pleasure-loving, lacking
in earnestness and depth of character, I regretfully
say, “I am afraid nothing will touch her
or wake her up to the realities of life until some
great grief comes to her.” What a pity to be
able to learn one’s lesson only at such great
cost!</p>

<p class='c011'>When Adoniram Judson, about to go to
India as one of the group of our earliest foreign
missionaries a little over one hundred years
ago, sought in marriage the hand of Ann Hasseltine,
of Bradford, he wrote as follows to her
father:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have now to ask whether you can consent
to part with your daughter early in the spring,
to see her no more in this world; whether you
can consent to her departure for a heathen land,
and her subjection to the hardships and sufferings
of a missionary life; whether you can consent
to her exposure to the dangers of the ocean;
to the fatal influence of the southern climate of
India; to every kind of want and distress; to
degradation, persecution, and perhaps a violent
death.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A remarkable letter, indeed! And Adoniram
Judson and Ann, his wife, did suffer most of the
hardships predicted. But if they had not, those
lands which sat in darkness would not have
seen a great light. The blessings of civilization
and of Christianity would not have spread to
the remotest parts of the earth as they have,
unless there had been some cast in heroic mould
who were ready to take their lives in their
hands and if need be pay the last full measure
of devotion.</p>

<p class='c011'>The habit of having everything one wants
and of doing all one desires to do is a fatal
habit and never should be formed at any age,
especially in youth. Instead, cultivate independence
of luxury and ease and learn the joy
that St. Paul felt in knowing that he had within
himself the power to meet and cope with whatever
difficulties, obstacles, or dangers life might
have in store for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this thought of Phillips Brooks we find
a striking likeness to the earnest message of
St. Paul to Timothy:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not pray for easy lives! Pray to be
stronger men! Do not pray for tasks equal to
your powers; pray for powers equal to your
tasks! Then the doing of your work shall be no
miracle, but you shall be a miracle. Every day
you shall wonder at yourself, at the richness of
life which has come in you by the grace of God.”</p>

  <h2 id='chV' class='c015'>V<br /> <br />THE RHYTHM OF LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In the third chapter of the Book of Ecclesiastes
occur some verses which have suggested
the subject of this talk. They illustrate a certain
balance or rhythm in nature and in life.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To everything there is a season, and a time
to every purpose under heaven;</p>

<p class='c011'>“A time to be born, and a time to die; a time
to plant and a time to pluck up that which is
planted;</p>

<p class='c011'>“A time to weep and a time to laugh; a time
to mourn and a time to dance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These words are used by the author, not so
much to illustrate the rhythm of life as its
monotony. He is not admiring the wonderful
harmony which meets us in nature wherever we
turn, so much as he is lamenting that there is
nothing new in nature or in human life. The
same things recur over and over again. The
sun rises in the morning only to go down again
in the evening, and the same process will be
repeated through endless to-morrows. “The
rivers all run into the sea, yet the sea is not
full.” “That which hath been is what shall
be.” Man is born, laughs and labors and
weeps, and when his little life is ended, dies.
This has been the history of countless multitudes
and it will be the history of countless
multitudes to come. There is nothing new
under the sun.</p>

<p class='c011'>Written as this book was at the darkest hour
of Hebrew history, at a time of oppression and
unrest, it is a sad book. The writer, a serious
and earnest-minded man, strives nobly to
discover light for himself and his race, but the
world looks dark. Yet he is a brave and devout
soul, and his book, so full of stimulus to
high endeavor, ought to be read more widely
than it is.</p>

<p class='c011'>The words I have quoted may well start
several different trains of thought. One of
these I will suggest. There is nothing new
under the sun, it is true; but we do not need
anything new. The same old things we have
always had are just what we need and shall
always need; as springtime and harvest, day
and night, work and rest. In the regular recurrence
of these great and necessary things is
found the rhythm of life in accordance with
which we live and must live. May we learn
something from nature’s ways that will help us
to make our lives strong? I think so.</p>

<p class='c011'>Have you ever thought of rhythm in nature?
Here there is no monotony, but constant and
beneficent change. Nothing, perhaps, is quite
so blessed as the sunshine, yet eternal day
would be almost as bad as eternal night. How
our tired eyes would long for the calm and restful
darkness! We love the springtime and the
warm days and the green growing things; but
how much more we love them because they
follow cold and snow, leafless trees and bare
earth!</p>

<p class='c011'>Nowhere do we find the rhythm of nature
better illustrated than in our bodies, these
wonderful machines only partially under our
control. Sleeping and waking, the contraction
and extension of the muscles, the inhalation
and exhalation of the breath are a few of the
many examples. The most important of all the
activities of the body, the systole and diastole
of the heart, Nature keeps within her own control,
and gives alternate work and rest to that
vital organ, as if to say that when it comes to
a matter of life and death, man cannot be
trusted to his own keeping. Fortunate it is that
this is so, for if it rested with us to decide when
they should work and when rest, some eager,
ambitious hearts would beat themselves to
death ere life had well begun.</p>

<p class='c011'>This polarity in nature is nowhere better
stated than in Emerson’s essay on “Compensation”:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Polarity, or action and reaction, we meet
in every part of nature; in darkness and light;
in heat and cold; in the ebb and flow of waters;
in male and female; in the inspiration and expiration
of plants and animals; in the systole
and diastole of the heart; in the undulations
of fluids and of sounds; in the centrifugal and
centripetal gravity; in electricity, galvanism
and chemical affinity. If the south attracts,
the north repels. To empty here, you must
condense there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>What can nature teach us of rhythm that
will help us build our lives up into rounded
completion? To begin with, we may learn
something of the relations which should exist
between us and our fellow men. The hermit
who withdraws himself from the society of his
fellows to live by himself, even though his purpose
may be to commune with nature or with
nature’s God, is not living in accordance with
God’s laws. Man is a social being and is
dependent upon intercourse with other human
beings for his complete development. No one
can cut himself off from his fellow men without
damage.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the other hand, too constant association
with others works even greater harm. Wordsworth
felt this when he wrote:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The world is too much with us: late and soon,</div>
      <div class='line'>Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:</div>
      <div class='line'>Little we see in Nature that is ours;</div>
      <div class='line'>We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>We may learn from nature’s rhythm of life
that we need both society and solitude. To
adjust these to each other in proper degree is a
problem for each of us. Are you one of the unfortunate
persons who cannot be happy for a
moment unless in the company of others? If so,
you are preparing an unhappy future. If you
find yourself so dull a companion, how can you
expect others to find you interesting? You are
not developing the resources without which no
life can be permanently happy. Give yourself
occasionally an opportunity to think your own
thoughts, to question your own heart, and to
get acquainted with yourself. You will be all
the better a companion to others for it, and,
moreover, you will be better company for
yourself, for you will be led to develop inner resources.
I once heard an Indian Buddhist
priest tell of the custom in his country of requiring
each child in a family to spend one hour
a day quietly in a room by himself, “thinking
good thoughts.” An hour a day so spent by
some young people I know would be helpful in
arousing to greater independence of mind and
originality of thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some of us, however, need to make serious
effort to acquire the power of entering easily
into cordial relations with others. If you have
a tendency to hold aloof, if you are not at
your ease with those with whom you happen
to be thrown, and find it difficult to enter into
friendly relations with them, set yourself earnestly
to correct this defect. Such tendencies
allowed to go unchecked are almost sure to
result in many lonely hours.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meditation without action makes dreamers.
Constant activity without reflection means a
loss of the intellectual grasp of things. Jesus,
after a day of the most active ministry, usually
sought the loneliness of the mountains and
there found strength for the work of the following
day. So, on one day in seven, our busy,
hurrying tasks cease, and we have a day for rest
and worship. Let us do all we can to guard
Sunday against the dangers that threaten it
and that would make it exactly like all other
days. To say nothing of its religious uses, the
rhythm of life demands that one day in the
week be given to rest and to thoughts and
interests far removed from those of our busy
work-days. Some one has said that Sunday
should be <em>joyous</em> (unlike the Sunday of the
Puritans), <em>different</em>, that is, different from the
other days of the week, and <em>uplifting</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not until we have passed out of early youth
are we likely to comprehend the fact that life
itself has tidal times. A mood of exaltation
is likely to be followed by one of depression.
Life waxes and wanes; it does not stand still.
We learn to take ourselves at our best and to
be patient with ourselves at our worst. When
faith and courage are low, we come to know
that soon they will return in all their strength.
Doubt of self and one’s powers will be followed
by self-confidence. Thus we learn never to
make important decisions or to begin new and
weighty enterprises at ebb tide. There is, in
another sense from that which Shakespeare
meant, “a tide in the affairs of men” which
should be seized.</p>

<p class='c011'>Work and play are both essential in the
healthy life. We know the result of “all work
and no play.” Even good, wholesome, congenial
work makes us dull if it is never relieved and
brightened by recreation. Many a faithful
worker has broken down under the strain of
unremitting toil, who might have doubled or
trebled his years of usefulness if a little play
could have been mingled with the work.</p>

<p class='c011'>To one who plays all the time, that is, who
has no work in life, play soon becomes stale and
wearisome. After the period of childhood is
passed, when play should be the main business
of life, it seems to be an inexorable law of nature
that those who will not work shall not
play. Have you ever visited any of the great
winter resorts of the South? If so you have
noticed that they are filled largely with people
who have no pursuit in life except that of having
a good time. While the world’s work is
being done by others, they lead a butterfly
existence. What wonder that they wear a discontented
look! Everywhere they seek for
happiness and wonder why they fail to find the
elusive creature. It would not be difficult to
tell them. Those who refuse to do the world’s
work are denied a share in its play, and thus
does Nature assert the supremacy of her laws.</p>

<p class='c011'>No people in the world have so good a time
when they play as those who work hard—if
they also know how to play well. Self-denial,
waiting, and anticipation give a zest to pleasure
that can come in no other way. In one of
Charles Lamb’s essays he speaks of the keen
delight which he and his sister took, during the
days when toil was unceasing and income small,
on the rare occasions when they could afford
to go to the theater. The poorest seats amply
satisfied their desires, and it seemed to them
that no one in the house was so happy as they.
“Could those good old one-shilling gallery days
return, could you and I be once more struggling
up those inconvenient staircases, pushed
about and squeezed and elbowed by the poorest
rabble of poor gallery scramblers, I would
be willing to bury more wealth than Crœsus
had to purchase it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The woman who gives herself up wholly to a
society life never finds happiness in that life;
but let her make something really worth while
her main object, whether it be bringing up a
family, writing books, or working in a settlement,
and her social pleasures will then give
her relaxation and delight. It is the student
who works hard and who feels the glow of accomplishment
who can put most zest into a
game on the athletic field.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our country probably has more workers than
any other who do not take enough time to play.
It is so easy for our earnest, energetic people to
fall into this habit. Work is sweet and we think
we cannot have too much of it. Sometimes, too,
we get an exaggerated idea of our own importance.
We think that if we stop work for a moment
all the wheels of progress will stand still.
Never did any people feel the intensity of life
as we Americans of this generation do. We
have heard the gospel of efficiency preached on
every hand, but we have not often been told
how to maintain a high level of efficiency for
a long period. Those who are efficient, and at
the same time willing, invariably have more put
upon them than they can do. In addition to
legitimate work, there is auxiliary work of various
kinds. Committee meetings and other
services for the general good consume for many
of us a great deal of time. So we keep chasing
duties and go to bed every night plagued by the
host that we have left undone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, shall we regret that we live in an age
of opportunity? If we are counted among the
efficient, who are given a large share of work to
do, shall we be sorry? On the contrary, let us
remember that more to be pitied than any one
else is the person who, because he has no work
in life, is obliged to hunt for occupation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The real trouble is that most of us do not
know the secret of economizing our time and
strength. Let us ask what the rhythm of life
demands of us. No one is capable of incessant
toil without serious damage. Our highest good
demands that there shall be constant alternation
of labor and rest, or work and play. Some
forms of work are play because they involve different
powers of mind and body from our regular
work. Many a scholar has studied until his
eyes were dimmed and his mind dulled only to
find that he had himself defeated his own purpose.
Many a business man has given himself
no rest until increasing inefficiency compelled
it. It is not the teacher who makes a practice
of working late into the night, with never a
moment for play, who makes the inspiring
classroom instructor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some one has given this recipe for a happy
life: “Work, play, study, laugh; have a job and
a hobby.” Play should be regarded as a legitimate
part of the business of life. Duty has been
only half performed when happy recreation has
been left out.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wise student has, all through a hard
term’s work, preserved the balance between
work and play, society and solitude. Unless
she has been particularly unfortunate she has
come to the end of the term only healthily tired.
By that I mean the kind of weariness from
which recuperation is rapid and easy. She has
not overdrawn her physical bank account. She
has not run in debt to the future. Beware of
any weariness of which that cannot be said.</p>

<p class='c011'>The daily life of work and play for all of us
ought to be so adjusted that each day’s strength
is sufficient for each day’s needs. Wherever the
conditions of work and play and of health are
right, this is true. But school life, both for
teachers and pupils, involves an unusual
amount of wear and tear on the nervous system,
and hence we should be more careful
than others, industrial workers, for example, to
see that this strain never becomes unduly severe.
Few teachers or students could stand
fifty weeks of school work in a year, an amount
which in many occupations is accepted as a
matter of course. That is the reason we have
so many vacations. When vacation comes,
then, let us realize its need, and its purpose;
namely, to restore the balance of body and
mind by allowing the beneficent restorative
processes of Nature to do their work upon us;
and let us coöperate heartily with these forces.
Some do not do this, but hinder Nature instead
of helping her. Some go home for a three
weeks’ vacation and spend the entire time in
a whirl of social dissipation. Ask yourself
whether that restores your powers so that you
return to your work with mind and body at
their best? We rest, not for the sake of resting,
but that we may work better. Vacations are
given to restore the balance of life, not to
destroy it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And some students carry all their school
worries and responsibilities with them into vacation.
They dream of their work by night
and think of it by day. They count up all the
lessons that must be learned and all the themes
that must be written, as if there would not be
a day in which to do each day’s work. “Take
no thought [worry] for the things of the morrow,
for the morrow will take thought for the
things of itself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet, when the long summer vacation
comes, I wonder if even a young student is
justified in using it <em>all</em> for play. We older people,
if we are doing a work in the world which
we consider worth while, take an entire summer
for play but rarely. The reason is that
life is too short for all one wants to learn or to
accomplish, and so each long vacation must see
the fulfillment of some of the tasks which we
have set for ourselves. For the student there
is a middle ground between working at school
tasks all summer and idling during the entire
time. Remember that a change of occupation
is one form of rest. If a portion of each
bountiful summer vacation were spent in learning
something quite worth while, yet different
from the ordinary school tasks, work and play
would each profit from the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>Have you sometimes been disturbed because
you did not feel just like beginning hard work
at the close of a vacation? Do not let that
trouble you. I have learned to distrust a vacation
at the close of which I find myself wearing
the harness too easily. We get the most out of
a vacation by making it as different as possible
from our regular work. The more different it
has been, the more difficult it is to get the mind
back into the usual channels.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the process of “getting up steam” is
over, and we settle down to steady work after
a good vacation, the sensation is one of the
most delightful I know. Here is an opportunity
to begin life all over again, and by retrieving
the mistakes of the past, to make the future
worthier. As the weeks stretch out ahead of us,
they loom up big with opportunity and privilege.
Start home for your next vacation, then,
with a resolution in your heart that you will so
spend it that when it is over, this new outlook
upon life and work shall be yours; for the chief
purpose of a vacation is to restore the rhythm
of life.</p>

  <h2 id='chVI' class='c015'>VI<br /> <br />THE USES OF TROUBLE</h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then, welcome each rebuff</div>
      <div class='line'>That turns earth’s smoothness rough,</div>
      <div class='line'>Each sting that bids not sit nor stand but go!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>You read these familiar words of Browning,
but you do not believe them. There must be
trouble in the world, you say. There must be
rebuffs and stings and hardness, and they
must be endured; but as to finding good in such
things—why pretend it?</p>

<p class='c011'>But why talk to young people about trouble?
It is well that the mind should be filled with
happiness and hope, yet to ignore the other
and darker side of life does not abolish it. The
question of the place of adversity in life is one
that has occupied thinking minds ever since
the world began; and since no one can hope to
escape the common lot it is well to get ready
for trouble before it comes. Young people are
really no less interested than their elders in
serious subjects. They care for the deeper
things of life and they long to understand
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>One must be very young, indeed, not to have
had some hard experience of one’s own, some
disappointment or struggle or sorrow. Sometimes
these are troubles that are apparent to
all, and our hearts go out in sympathy and in
a yearning desire to comfort. Sometimes they
are kept close shut from others. “The heart
knoweth its own bitterness.” If you have
never been called to go through deep waters
yourself, perhaps you have had to stand by and
suffer in sympathy while some one you loved
has done so.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, youth has its own disappointments,
its own griefs and sorrows to bear, often
unguessed by those who are older. Did you
believe that the world was all goodness, and
have you suffered the shock that comes to
every sensitive soul upon discovering that it is
a very bad as well as a very good world? How
can God be in his heaven and all right with the
world, when there is so much sorrow and suffering
and sin? It takes a long time to think these
problems out, and their solution in full comes
only with the “years that bring the philosophic
mind.” For some it never comes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Have you lost faith in some one whom you
trusted, and are you therefore having a struggle
lest you lose all faith in human nature? Or do
you distrust yourself and your own powers?
While longing with passionate earnestness to
be of use to the world, are you standing on the
threshold of life all uncertain what place there
may be for you or whether there may be any?
To all these perplexities often are added religious
doubts. One does not know what one
may believe and wonders if one may believe
anything. Many young people, in their process
of adjustment to real life, pass through an
experience no less serious than the going down
into the “Everlasting No,” described by Carlyle.
Many of the interests and the beliefs of
childhood are outgrown, while those of mature
manhood or womanhood have not yet taken
their place and the soul seems adrift. We who
are older seldom appreciate either the seriousness
or the sacredness of such experiences in
the young. One reason why these are often so
tragic is that youth lacks the perspective for
judging them. There are as yet no long memories.
One believes that what is now will
always be. There is no remembrance of the
conquest of past difficulties by which to judge
the present.</p>

<p class='c011'>So much to show that life is not all sunshine
even when we are twenty! But these experiences,
tragic as they seem at the time, will, if
nobly lived through, bring their own compensation
in truer self-knowledge and greater
depth and earnestness of character. We learn
from them, too, the necessity for readjustment.
We learn to adapt ourselves to the real world in
which we find ourselves instead of to the unreal
world of our dreams.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I slept and dreamed that life was beauty;</div>
      <div class='line'>I woke and found that life was duty.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>This process of readjustment involves the reconciling
of the two, the discovery that the life
of duty to which we wake is at the same time
the life of beauty of which we dreamed.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this process of readjustment, the first
thing to learn is that it is not necessary that we
should have everything we want. Indeed, it
is not necessary that we should be happy. As
soon as we recognize that fact we are on the
way to happiness. How many spoiled children
of indulgent parents there are who do not learn
this except through some unhappy experience!
How many such have I watched with interest
and sympathy when the idea first dawned upon
their minds that, perhaps, after all, life was not
going to bring them everything they demanded!
Their pitifully narrow and selfish ideas must be
uprooted and broad and generous ideas must
take their place before even a beginning will
have been made toward a fruitful life. In a
world where none of us can have just what we
want, where no life is ever carried out exactly
as planned, and where any day may rob us of
what we have cherished most, it behooves us
to form early in life the habit of making the
most of whatever comes our way. Of nothing
is this more true than of those things we do
not welcome, that seem hard and forbidding.
Usually they are not what they seem, but are
friends in disguise, as Browning tells us.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are many kinds of trouble, and, of
course, some kinds are harder to bear than
others. Hardships and rebuffs might rank as
the easiest. Loss of money or material possessions
is not as serious as at first it seems. Grief
is much more difficult to bear. Yet of whatever
kind or degree the adversities of life, it is probable
that each, as Shakespeare puts it, wears
a precious jewel in its head.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are several ways of meeting trouble.
One wrong way is to regard it in a spirit of rebellion,
and by constant brooding over what
might have been, to allow it to embitter and
spoil life. We have all known people who went
through life meeting trouble in this way.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another and a better way to meet trouble is
with stoical resignation. This does undoubtedly
bring strength, but it does not bring sweetness.
One has not really gained the victory
unless he goes further.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is something better than to quarrel
with trouble and there is something better
than merely to endure it, and that is to compel
it, before we are through with it, to do us good,
even as Jacob wrested a blessing from the angel.
It is natural to think that our troubles only
restrict and limit; but we may find even in
the most overwhelming disaster that which
enriches life. That is the reason it so often
happens that one who has known the depths
of sorrow is a tower of strength upon whom
others may lean, or a well of comfort and inspiration
from which they may draw. Nothing
has yet been discovered so good for the development
of character as struggle. Deep human
sympathy and the power to enter into the
sorrows of others are born of suffering.</p>

<p class='c011'>Have you not known some wealthy family
whose riches suddenly took wings, to the enormous
gain of every one of its members? Sons,
whose lives of luxurious ease were rapidly hurrying
them along the road to ruin are now
forced to become self-supporting and thus
acquire those manly virtues which before had
been wanting. Daughters, obliged to shoulder
some of the responsibilities of life and plan for
others instead of for their own selfish pleasure,
are made strong and womanly.</p>

<p class='c011'>To be stricken by an incurable disease would
seem to be the worst misfortune that could
befall any human being. Yet, if so, why is it
that invalids are so often the sunniest, most
serene, most stimulating persons we know? I
have chanced to be acquainted with several
such in my life to whom I would go if in need
of a word of encouragement or inspiration.
All the disappointment in the failure of life’s
plans, all the suffering and pain have been
transmuted into character. If, after all, the
chief purpose of life is the making of character,
we need not be so concerned over the means.
It is for us to take the material provided, and
with the means given to accomplish a worthy
result. “Life is the raw material,” says Goethe,
“and man the artist who is to shape it into a
thing of beauty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I know a lady who lost in quick succession
all her children. She might have become hard
and bitter, crying out against the injustice that
took her children while other happy mothers
are surrounded by their little ones. Instead she
became an angel of mercy to all the needy children
within her reach. By her efficient work
for pure-milk laws, better sanitary conditions,
vacation playgrounds, and free kindergartens,
she doubtless prevented many other mothers
from having to mourn as she mourned. She is
gentler, kindlier, more loving, more unselfish
than before her great sorrow came to her, and
her life is probably of much more value to the
world than it would have been otherwise. She
transmuted her sorrow into unselfish service.
“When He hath tried me I shall come forth as
gold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Why trouble comes to us and why it comes
in the forms it does, he must be a very wise
person who presumes to say. One of the world-poets
of old wrote a great poem upon the problem
of suffering. Yet Job did not find out why
God sent trouble to him, though he learned
that it was not sent as a punishment. He also
learned what his attitude should be toward it
and in what spirit he should bear it. And for
us, too, it is far more important that we should
meet trouble in the right way than that we
should know why it comes. Are you carrying
some burden or bearing some cross that often
seems too heavy? And do you sometimes feel
rebellious about it and contrast your lot with
that of some one who has no such cross to bear?
That is unworthy of your best self, as you well
know. It is for you to see to it that this
trouble, whatever it may be, not only does not
spoil your character and your life, but that it
enriches both. It is, perhaps, the best means
you will ever have to acquire certain qualities
which you need and which, perhaps, you greatly
admire in others. By this trial you are being
tested. By the way you endure it will all your
future life be determined. It is your part to become,
not in spite of this burden, but because
of it, a larger person than you were before.</p>

<p class='c011'>An insight into some of the immutable laws
of life helps us to endure hard things. No law
is probably more steadfast than the law of compensation,
as Emerson clearly shows us in his
remarkable essay on that subject, an essay
which should be read by every young person
who is trying to formulate a philosophy of life.
“For everything you miss you gain something
else, and for everything you gain you lose
something.” When you are obliged to give up some
cherished project or dear ambition, try to discover
what you received in its place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps you long to be a musician, an artist,
or a scholar, and perhaps certain duties and
obligations life has created for you prevent the
fulfillment of this cherished dream. Then find
your self-realization in those things which are
permitted you. “What we need is not so much
to realize the ideal as to idealize the real.”
Nothing so rapidly develops character in a
young person as the shouldering of responsibility.
While one of your friends may have
been perfecting herself in music or art, or
broadening herself by foreign travel, you have
been carrying heavy burdens for others. Has it,
therefore, been all loss to you and all gain to
her? Far from it. Instead, she has gained one
thing, you another. Most of us do not receive
more than our share in life. You will be surprised
if you look about you to discover how
true this is. Apply the test to your friends and
acquaintances one by one, and you will see
that the advantages of each are more or less
counterbalanced by the disadvantages, so that
things are by no means so unjustly arranged
as it would at first seem.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another thought that may help us to adjust
ourselves to the hard things in our lives is that
it takes some losses, some disappointments and
sorrows to make us appreciate the good things
that we have. Youth is wasteful, not realizing
its riches. It always remains true that what
we do not realize does not exist, for us. A part
of the law of compensation is that the more
we lose, the more highly we prize what is left.
That, perhaps, is the greatest compensation
for growing older. Though the relentless years
have taken away much to which we clung with
tenacity, yet, somehow, we have come to place
so high a valuation upon what remains that we
often grow happier in spite of persistent and
increasing losses. In the old story of the Sibylline
Books, there is a thought of very wide
application.</p>

<p class='c011'>How little do we know which paths lead to
happiness and success! We are sure, however,
that we do know and rebel at the least deviation
from the road we had marked out. Yet
again and again a Power wiser than ourselves
changes the direction of the path, and compels
us to travel a different and unwelcome way.
Afterward, looking back, we often realize that
the best things life has brought us have come
along that road of the defeat of cherished plans.
These words of Emerson should be taken to
heart by every young person who is having a
severe struggle or who is passing through fiery
trials:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“We cannot part with our friends. We cannot
let our angels go. We do not know that
they only go out, that archangels may come in.
A fever, a mutilation, a cruel disappointment, a
loss of wealth, a loss of friends, seems at the
moment unpaid loss, and unpayable. But the
sure years reveal the deep remedial force that
underlies all facts. The death of a dear friend,
wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing but
privation, somewhat later assumes the aspect
of a guide or genius; for it commonly operates
revolutions in our way of life, terminates an
epoch of infancy or of youth which was waiting
to be closed, breaks up a wonted occupation,
or a household, or style of living, and allows
the formation of new ones more friendly to the
growth of character. It permits or constrains
the formation of new acquaintances, and the
reception of new influences that prove of the
first importance to the next years; and the man
or woman who would have remained a sunny
garden-flower, with no room for its roots and
too much sunshine for its head, by the falling
of the walls and the neglect of the gardener is
made the banyan of the forest, yielding shade
and fruit to wide neighborhoods of men.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c015'>VII<br /> <br />SCHOOL SPIRIT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Among the forces which shape young men
and women in our educational institutions,
none is more potent than that indefinable, intangible,
powerful thing we call school spirit,
or college spirit, as the case may be. Students
are often mistaken in the expression of it, but
the spirit is right, though the expression may be
wrong. School spirit always represents an unselfish
attitude of the student. He has heard
the call of something larger than himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though school spirit may be only a sentiment,
it is that which gives its deepest richness
to the life of a good school. It belongs to an
epoch in the life of the student that can never
be repeated and never forgotten. It is the
source, not only of much of the truest happiness
of the precious school days, but of stimulus
to high endeavor.</p>

<p class='c011'>While there are many day schools that have
a fine and strong school spirit, it reaches
its height only in those schools and colleges
where the students live a common corporate
life, away from their homes and other influences
which tend to separate them instead of
unite them. Such communities foster the closeness
and intimacy necessary to that complete
solidarity essential for strong school spirit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many things operate to draw the members
of a student body together. The games and
sports, the fun and frolic, are shared by all.
The work, if not the same, is done under the
same conditions. All inherit the common school
traditions and the same ideals of life are put
before all. These things tend to eliminate distinctions
and to make for democracy. In short,
they foster school spirit.</p>

<p class='c011'>The life of a corporate group is something
different from the lives of the individuals who
compose it. The members of such a group act
and react upon one another. Their impulses
and emotions, their words and even their
deeds take different tone and shape when in
the midst of numbers of others similarly circumstanced.
There is a latent fire in the soul
which is fanned to flame by the contact of life
with life. This infection of nature by nature
operates for evil as well as for good. Its harmful
influence is seen at its worst in what is
called mob spirit or mob rule. The mob may
be guilty of deeds which not a single individual
in it would countenance if left to himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>By the mere fact of your coming together,
then, surrounded by the same influences, under
the spell of the same traditions and ideals, you
create an element of life which did not exist
before and which reacts powerfully upon every
one of you. This is of the greatest importance
in the growth of character, especially in these
formative years. If you are ever to come to
complete self-realization, you must breathe
the atmosphere of pure and wholesome social
influences. You should ask yourself, then,
concerning the joint social life which you are
living from day to day, what you are gathering
from it and what you are contributing to it.</p>

<p class='c011'>As I stood once in the chapel of Eton College,
England, I noticed upon the walls certain
scrolls and tablets containing hundreds of
names in letters of gold. These were the names
of graduates of Eton who had in after years
brought distinction to their college. I noticed
the same family names, recurring over and over
again, and I was told that these same names
are still upon the school rolls. I could not help
asking myself, How can any young man who
enters Eton, bearing one of these honored
names, be anything but his best self? His family,
his school, his country expect it. Perhaps
that is one reason he so often <em>is</em> his best and
that the same families generation after generation
have so large a share of good and great
men. And I thought, too, what a stimulus
there must be in the very atmosphere of that
splendid, five-hundred-year-old school, to spur
these young men on to their highest endeavor!
They were honored in being members of Eton
and they in turn must honor Eton.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this country we have no schools as old as
Eton; yet all good schools have their fine traditions.
The true-hearted service of noble lives
has gone into the making of them. Of all such
schools it may be said that among their sons
or daughters are those who have loved their
<em>Alma Mater</em> so well that being a credit to her
they have counted among their chief aims in
life. Only the student who is moved by such
motives as these has the true school spirit.
Such a student longs that his school shall be
stamped with the stamp of true worthiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>I suppose the most evident, certainly the
most picturesque, exhibition of school spirit is
to be seen in connection with athletics, and it
reaches its climax in an inter-school game. The
authorities of some schools say frankly that
they permit such games, with their interruption
of serious work and other disadvantages,
chiefly because they tend to develop school
spirit and school loyalty. Athletic contests are
good, for they give training in self-subordination,
self-control, alertness, and dogged perseverance.
The individual loses himself in the
good of the whole. This makes for character
and good citizenship. We must not underestimate
the value of the enthusiasm which
comes from rallying against a common antagonist.
When the rivalry is good-natured and
every rule of fair play is observed, the effect is
wholesome.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet it is not always the student who cheers
most loudly for the team and who is most carried
away by school spirit on public occasions
who is at heart most loyal to the school. There
is a greater loyalty even than that generous
spirit which prompts one to rejoice in victory.
It is the desire that one’s school shall stand only
for that which is right. It is the determination
that it shall be respected, and still more, that
it shall be worthy of respect.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, the first and most obvious thing about
any school is that it is an educational institution,
and as such it must stand or fall. If a
school is an educational failure, what avails its
success in some subordinate thing? No one can
take pride in an easy-going school to which any
one can gain admission, and in which any one
can remain, regardless of attainment. Students
are not likely to think of this aspect of the case
when they neglect their studies. They think the
matter wholly personal and believe that only
they are the sufferers. It is not so. By slack,
indifferent work you are lowering the standard
of your school, and you are thus disloyal. By
your act you say that you do not care to have
your school respected. This shows a lack of
a sense of indebtedness on your part to the
corporate group of which you are a member.
It means a failure to apply school spirit where
it was most needed. It is easier to sing and
cheer on some moving occasion, but which does
your school need more at your hands?</p>

<p class='c011'>What I have said about upholding the intellectual
standards of the school applies equally
to its standards in other matters. By your
dress, by your manners, by your behavior you
indicate, wherever you go, the character of
your school. You are its product. The world
does not stop to ask what is going on inside of
a school or what its influences are. The world
judges a school by its results. If you want your
school to be respected you cannot be too careful
to represent it worthily at all times and in
all places.</p>

<p class='c011'>You come to school to get knowledge, but it
would be a pity if that were all you were to get.
A young man and a young woman, each of
whom had been out of college several years,
were discussing the advantages of a college
education. One said to the other, “Looking
back over your college days, what do you now
regard as the most valuable thing you got out
of college?” “Inspiration,” promptly came the
answer; and both were agreed upon this.</p>

<p class='c011'>School days deal with an earlier period of life
than the college age, when the student is usually
more susceptible to strong influences. The
school that first gave you the determination to
do something worth while in the world, the
school that called forth your best self and set
your heart on fire with a noble purpose, has a
claim upon you that you can never forget.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every school that has this transforming
power is what it is by virtue of the personalities
that have been connected with it. Ask yourself
what you are doing to make your school in
the future as inspiring a place for others as
others have made it for you. Ask yourself
what you can contribute to the enrichment of
the life of your school. Be not over-anxious
about what you shall receive.</p>

<p class='c011'>Students rarely realize how much they leave
behind them when they depart from a school.
Something of you remains, mysteriously interwoven
in the life of the school. “I am a part of
all that I have met,” says Tennyson’s Ulysses.
Just as you embody in yourself the influences
that hundreds of other lives have exerted upon
you, so others are bearing and will always bear
the marks of your influence.</p>

<p class='c011'>To be a worthy member of a good school is a
great privilege, furnishing as it does a stimulus
to high endeavor which rarely comes in any
other way. It is a distinct honor to sustain and
enhance a worthy name. If you have the right
school spirit, you can do nothing less than
throw all the power of your influence into the
task of making your school a place where future
students may learn how to meet and be true
to the responsibilities and obligations of life.
The atmosphere which makes easy this kind of
growth is created only by living personalities,
by the touch of life upon life.</p>

  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c015'>VIII<br /> <br />MAKING THE BEST OF THINGS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I have noticed that many people who seem
to the casual observer to be favorites of fortune,
having no large and serious troubles to
worry about, so magnify their small ones that
life loses much of its joy. Most men and women
who rebel at their lot in life fancy that their
discontent lies in the deprivation of some definite
thing. Had it not been for this or that
unfavorable condition, their lives would have
been happy and successful. One possesses too
small a share of this world’s goods and continually
allows his thoughts to dwell upon what
he might have had or might have done if he had
been blessed with wealth. He forgets to appreciate
and to be grateful for health, family,
friends, and a host of other blessings. He has
the lurking feeling that wealth is the one thing
which would have made his life happy, in spite
of the fact that he knows that it has not
brought happiness to many who possess it.
So he settles down to a discontented, second-rate
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>With another, it is a lack of robust health
that causes discontent. Such a person forgets
that much of the best work of the world has
been accomplished by men of frail health, as,
for instance, Darwin and Herbert Spencer.
Another finds a source of unhappiness in his
environment in life, or in a lack of particular
advantages and opportunities. He is sure that
he might have become an artist or a musician
or a scholar had not Fate been so unkind as to
deprive him of opportunity. Yet we have but
to point to scores of persons who have won the
highest success in these fields in spite of seemingly
insurmountable obstacles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some women are unhappy because they cannot
obtain the position in society for which
they believe themselves fitted; others crave luxury
and ease denied them. Many women long
to exchange their idleness for a work in life.
As to work, it sometimes seems as if half the
workers of the world are envying the other half
their particular field of labor. Each sees the
advantages of the other’s task, but not its disadvantages.
The laboring man envies the
business or professional man the supposed ease
of his work and its larger returns. The business
or professional man often looks with envy
upon the day laborer, because of his freedom
from care and the simplicity of his life. And so
each looks over the edge of his work, discontented,
to that of his neighbor. How seldom
are we willing to admit that the cause of our
discontent lies within ourselves!</p>

<p class='c011'>It is true that there is a discontent which is
right. It is discontent with what we <em>are</em> and
it is born of aspiration. One who feels this
divine discontent well knows that his life has
not been as fruitful as it should have been, and
he is determined that the future shall redeem,
as far as possible, the inadequacy of the past.
He says with Whittier:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I better know than all</div>
      <div class='line'>How little I have gained,</div>
      <div class='line'>How vast the unattained!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>If ever we find ourselves satisfied with our attainments
it simply means that we have a very
low standard of success. Some one has said,
“One should never believe that he has succeeded,
but always that he is going to succeed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To be discontented with what we have, that
is, with our possessions and our circumstances,
is a very different matter. Either we can change
them or we cannot. If we can and do not, we
have only ourselves to blame. But what shall
be said regarding those unfavorable outward
circumstances of your life to which you must
submit? Simply this: If you cannot have what
you like, <em>learn to like what you have</em>. Resolve
that no unfavorable conditions shall be powerful
enough to defeat you and spoil your life.
Master your circumstances instead of letting
them master you. To master circumstances
does not necessarily mean to change them.
Sometimes it means merely to change our attitude
toward them, so that they may become a
source of strength instead of weakness. There
is always much that a wise and energetic person
can do to change the conditions of his life, yet
there will be left in every life certain things
that cannot be altered. The real test of our
character is our attitude toward these things.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is nothing more certain than that if
you are going to accomplish anything in life
you must use the vantage-ground you have,
not the better vantage-ground of another, which
is not yours. Do not explain what you would
have done if you had had this one’s or that
one’s opportunity. You will be tested by the
use you make of the opportunities that have
been given to <em>you</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is sometimes pointed out that too many
college girls, returning to their homes after
graduation, lead restless, discontented lives.
The college is often blamed for this, but most
unjustly. The difficulty may be with the girl
herself, but I believe it is just as often with her
family and friends, who expect impossible
things of her. Too often an active, ambitious
girl is forced to settle down into a life of comparative
uselessness. The inspiration of her
college years is still strong upon her. All the
powers of heart, mind, and soul have been
awakened. She has gained a wide outlook, and
the needs of this very needy world have been
brought home to her sympathetic heart. She
feels within her the power to do something
which will count in making the world a better
place. To be a mere household ornament does
not seem to her adequate. Too frequently
there is the strongest objection to her taking
up any definite work. She is expected to be
happy in comparative idleness and without the
stimulus that always comes from feeling that
one’s life is counting for something. Some of
the discontent of the educated young woman
who has not yet found her place in life may be
traced to these causes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet sometimes her discontent has its root in
herself, and is due to a lack of adaptation.
Many a young woman who leaves school or
college with dreams of an inspiring and useful
work in the world finds herself obliged to remain
at home because of family necessity. She
may even have to live in a place apparently
devoid of interest, amid surroundings that
seem commonplace, with no stimulating or
congenial companionship. Sometime you may
find yourself in exactly that position. What
will you do about it? Will you adopt a course
that will not only make those about you miserable,
but will dwarf and narrow your own life?
Or can you be brave and strong enough to follow
the path that will enlarge and beautify your
life as well as bring good to others? If you are
in doubt what to do, ask yourself what an Alice
Freeman Palmer would have done with those
meager surroundings, those narrow opportunities
and uninspiring duties. You know the
answer. A great soul like hers would have created
its own atmosphere and soon the desert
would have blossomed as the rose. She would
have seen possibilities in the dreariest situation.
She would have found work to do in the
smallest and most uninteresting community.
Wherever there is a community there is work
to be done—little children to be guided into
right ways, the sick to be visited, the discouraged
to be cheered. Wherever you find a
church, there is an opportunity for service.
Who ever heard of a church that had workers
enough? Wherever there is a city, town, or
village, there is work to be done in the direction
of civic betterment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Is your life restricted by certain responsibilities
not of your own choosing, yet from
which you cannot honorably escape—nay,
would not escape? Do you long for freedom,
for the power to carve out your own destiny
in your own way? How swiftly you would
move forward if you could tread the path of
your own choosing! Do not think that you are
unusual in this longing. It is difficult to be
reconciled to the limitations placed upon us.
Those of whom you are most envious are probably
in their turn envying others who have
not their particular limitations. Some of them
may be envying you. A lesson which we should
all learn as early as possible is that the restrictions
of our lives often point the way to
largeness. Whenever we find ourselves indulging
in self-pity because of the limitations under
which we labor, it will be well to call to mind
some of the many splendid and fruitful lives
that have attained to strength and power in
spite of restrictions far more severe, or rather
partly because of them: Lincoln, gaining a
meager knowledge of books by the light of a
pine knot; Darwin, doing his life-work in the
face of physical disabilities that would have
made useless invalids of most of us; Helen
Keller, denied all the most important avenues
of communication with the outside world, yet
achieving results that would put most of us to
shame; Louisa M. Alcott, writing her charming
stories in the midst of arduous toil and
pathetic privations endured for the sake of
her loved ones; and Elizabeth Barrett Browning,
learning from suffering what she told the
world in song. History is full of these examples,
and the future will be just as rich in
such lives as the past has been. Those who
are to be the leaders of the next generation
are even now, many of them, having a severe
struggle with adverse circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just as we should make the best of the things
about us and of the circumstances of our lives,
so we should make the best of the people about
us. Must you live apart from the friends whose
society is most congenial to you? Again, if you
cannot have about you the people you like,
then like the people you have about you. It is
astonishing how much progress can be made
when one starts out with resolution in this direction.
Try it and you will be amazed at discovering
likable qualities in those with whom
you supposed you had little in common.</p>

<p class='c011'>And just as you are to make the best of other
people, so you should learn to make the best
of yourself. By this I do not mean make the
<em>most</em> of yourself. It goes without saying that
one should do that. Many a person who is successful
in matching himself against outward
obstacles feels discouraged when he faces his
own nature and recognizes the return of faults
which he hoped he had overcome. No struggle
is so severe as that which one wages with himself.
Sometimes we become disheartened at our
failure to conquer faults and to overcome wrong
tendencies. When it is a question of right and
wrong, there is no course open to us but to continue
to wage the battle. No compromise with
wrong is possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet there are other limitations which should
be regarded in a different light. Perhaps we
have overestimated our capacity and have expected
the impossible of ourselves. Paris is full
of discouraged artists who had looked forward
to a noteworthy career that never can be realized.
Every publisher of books has some comprehension
of the enormous number of would-be
authors there are of whom the world will
never hear. Ambition is good, but disappointed
ambition too often embitters life. Most of us
have some limitations which cannot be removed.
Certain of these limitations it is well
to accept and not beat one’s wings forever
against the bars.</p>

<p class='c011'>Others may surpass you because of greater
natural endowments or larger opportunity, or
both, but this should not move you from the
even tenor of your way. No less faulty than
the complacent, self-satisfied life is the life
spoiled because of unfulfilled ambitions. We
should accept ourselves, with the limitations
that cannot be removed, and go about it to
make, with the material at hand, the most
successful life possible. The highest of all attainments,
the living of a successful life, depends
not upon outward circumstances, not
upon opportunities, not upon freedom from
annoyances or even from trials and sorrows.
In the last analysis it depends upon one’s power
to make the best and the most of those things
which belong to his portion. If one can do that,
life has no terrors for him. No misfortune or
disappointment can prevail against him or disturb
the serenity of his soul. He can say with
Henley:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

      <div class='line'>“It matters not how strait the gate,</div>

  <h2 id='chIX' class='c015'>IX<br /> <br />CONFLICTING LOYALTIES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Some of the saddest yet most common tragedies
enacted in life about us have their source
in the conflict between duty to self and duty to
others. Is it because of our innate selfishness
that so many sermons need to be preached to
us about our duty to others? Perhaps it is
thought that duty to self is so natural that we
do not need a great deal of urging or warning
in that direction. At any rate, we hear
much less about our duty to ourselves than
about our duty to others. It is therefore not
strange that some generous and over-conscientious
souls should come to feel that when a
conflict arises between these two kinds of duties,
self should always sink out of sight. This,
however, is not a reasonable view. While the
words, “He who saveth his life shall lose it,”
are among the greatest ever uttered, yet we
must remember that He who spake them gave
us also the Parable of the Talents, and was
wroth with the man who took his one talent
and hid it in the earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many an earnest seeker after right is led to
protest against a view of duty so one-sided.
When one is urged to surrender self, to lose
self, to care naught what becomes of self, one is
led to cry, “But am <em>I</em> of no worth? Has God
not given me certain responsibilities with regard
to my own life, and have I not the solemn
duty of rendering back the talent given me,
increased as many-fold as possible?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The answer to these questions is unmistakable.
My responsibility for myself is one that
no other can assume. St. Paul states clearly
one of the best reasons why we have no right to
ignore self. “For every man must bear his own
burden.” If we cannot bear our own burdens,
others must bear them for us. But it is expected
that we shall do more than carry our
own load; for in the same chapter we are commanded,
“Bear ye one another’s burdens.”
The inconsistency is only apparent, not real.</p>

<p class='c011'>That self is not something to be effaced and
trodden under whenever possible seems to be
proved by the testimony of language. Let us
examine a few of the derivatives of the word
“self.” While some of these words suggest self-effacement,
others speak in no uncertain tones
of the dignity and worth of self.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Self-centered</em> is a term of reproach, but <em>self-reliance</em>
is a duty. <em>Self-seeking</em> is base, but
<em>self-possession</em> is commendable. <em>Self-complacency</em>
and <em>self-esteem</em> we despise, but <em>self-control</em>
and <em>self-confidence</em> are admired. Who can respect
any one who is lacking in <em>self-respect</em>?
<em>Self-sacrifice</em> is a word that brings a glow or a
thrill to the heart perhaps beyond any other;
yet <em>self-preservation</em> is sometimes one’s highest
duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Evidently, then, it is your duty to efface
yourself and to assert yourself; to humble yourself
and to respect yourself; to sacrifice yourself
and to preserve yourself. At any rate, it
seems clear that self is of importance and that
we cannot be complete persons without somehow
regarding self.</p>

<p class='c011'>For centuries philosophers have puzzled or
disputed over the definition of selfishness.
Where shall we draw the line between obligation
to self and obligation to others? Jeremy
Bentham, the English philosopher, went so far
as to say, “Dream not that man will lift his
little finger except for his own advantage.” If
he means that every one always seeks his own
personal advantage, as he seems to, he is absurdly
wrong. For proof of it you need look no
further than the first mother you meet who is
spending herself lavishly for her child. If he
means that each one really does what he most
wants to do, he is right. I once knew a girl
who had a delightful habit of spending most of
her allowance on others rather than on herself.
No good cause that needed help ever appealed
to her in vain. She was continually seeking
out individual needs which she could remedy.
When praise was bestowed upon one of her unselfish
acts, a schoolmate remarked, “Oh, that
isn’t unselfishness. She really <em>likes</em> to use her
money that way.” Yes, she does, but it is unselfishness
none the less. Her strongest inclinations
lead her in a direction not easily understood
by those who have had little practice
in unselfish acts. But to call her conduct selfish
is like calling white black, or light darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>The conflict between duty to self and duty
to others is at times only apparent; again, it is
painfully real. To determine what is an apparent
conflict and what a real is one of the
difficult problems we have to solve. It is surprising
how little help others, as a rule, can give
us in its solution; in fact, this is one of the
situations in life where we must stand alone—must
make our own decisions and bear the
responsibility for them. To try to follow the
judgment of others often results only in bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Should a young man or woman accept an
education to be paid for by money toilsomely
earned by self-sacrificing parents? We cannot
tell until we know all the circumstances. What
would be base selfishness in one case becomes
in another a sacred duty. Should the daughter
whose presence gives cheer leave the home for
a larger sphere of usefulness? Should the widowed
mother wear herself out and fill an early
grave in order that her children may have
the advantages which will make them intelligent
and useful men and women? Should the
physician sacrifice his life in order that the
devastating scourge may give up its secret and
other lives be saved? To what extent is it your
duty to imperil your health or your life for the
needs of others? There is not one of us who
does not sometimes meet with such questions
as these. As to minor questions involving the
same principles, we encounter them every day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just here I wish to point out certain frequent
fallacies regarding our duties and obligations.
The first is, that if you greatly desire to do or
to have a thing, it would therefore be selfish
for you to do it or to have it. The ascetics of
the Middle Ages acted on this assumption. They
practiced self-denial for the sake of self-denial,
without any larger aim. The ascetic sacrifices
himself for nothing. I have known people who
seemed to direct their lives in accordance with
the same theory. (They were always women!)
I once had a friend who did so. As soon as she
found that she had quite set her heart upon anything,
she promptly gave it up. If there was
something she did not want to do, she was sure
to do it, for it must be her duty. I need not
point out the unintelligence of this procedure.
To live with her was almost necessarily to grow
selfish. Did you ever think of the bad result
upon a family of having one unwisely unselfish
member? Such a person unconsciously develops
selfishness in the others. Excessive unselfishness
defeats itself. It does not even benefit
those for whom the sacrifice is made, but injures
them instead. Thus foolish mothers spoil
their children, wives ruin their husbands, sisters
destroy the character of their brothers, and
brothers even have been known to pet and
humor their sisters into egregious selfishness.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is evident, then, that duties to self and
duties to others are inextricably interwoven.
The thing which you want may be best for you,
and may serve the interests of others as well as
yourself. Securing an education, for example,
may double or treble your usefulness, not only
to the world in general, but to those individuals
who made the sacrifice in order that you might
have it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Self-sacrifice is noble, but if it is to be worthy
self-sacrifice, the end must be worthy. Nothing
could be finer, for example, than to risk one’s
life for another human being in danger, but we
have only contempt for the man who imperils
his life for no worthy end. That end must
always be a <em>larger self</em>, and we shall respect the
person in proportion to the worth of the larger
self. The family is a larger self, so is one’s
school, church, city. The soldier in obeying
the call of his country is serving a still larger
self, and this call rarely falls on deaf ears.
When the interests of the individual come into
conflict with the interests of the larger unit, the
individual’s interests must give way. Sometime
all good and intelligent people will realize
what only the few see now, that there is a larger
self even than country, and that is, humanity.
When that time comes, nation can no more
be arrayed against nation in the terrors of war.
There should be no conflict between loyalty to
country and loyalty to humanity, and the tragedy
of war is that there is such a conflict.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are many kinds of sacrifice besides the
sacrifice of life. The sacrifice of material things
is of no great moment, for they are not a part
of ourselves. The greatest sacrifice we can
make, next to that of life itself, is the sacrifice
of our own growth. Deliberately to remain
small, for the sake of duty, when we might have
been large, requires all the heroism of which
most of us are capable. Such a sacrifice has
been made times without number by parents
for their children and by sons or daughters for
the sake of parents dependent upon them. It
has been made by martyrs for their religion, by
patriots for their country. It has been made
by teachers for their pupils and by doctors and
nurses for their patients. If we sacrifice our
own larger growth and highest self-realization,—and
it is sometimes necessary,—let us see
to it that the end we aim to accomplish justifies
the damage to ourselves. It is to be feared that
such a sacrifice is often made without due consideration
of relative values. The young man
or woman who gives up an education for the sake
of rendering service to others should make sure
that the end aimed at is one of superlative
worth. The mother whom I knew, who refused
to allow her daughter to carry out her cherished
plan of going to college, simply because
she did not want to give up her daughter’s
companionship for four years, was an example
of pitiable and short-sighted selfishness. The
sacrifice she demanded was not justified because
it was for no worthy end.</p>

<p class='c011'>Often a great sacrifice of self now will mean
that one will have little to give by and by,
when the need may perhaps be larger. The self
you have to give now is small. Why not make it
larger before any complete self-surrender? We
cannot give unless we have something to give.
“If you would be a great giver,” says one of
our philosophers, “you must first be a great person.”
You dream of enriching the world with
your life. Then make it a rich life.</p>

<p class='c011'>A second fallacy often held is that obligations
for which one is not likely to be called to
account until the distant future are less binding
than those which make their claim felt now.
None of us acknowledge that we so regard
duty; but if we do not, it is difficult to account
for some of our actions. For the sake of fashion
or of vanity modes of dress are often
followed which are bound to result in impairment
of health. Wrong habits of eating injure the
digestion, late hours drain the vitality. Thus
we buy present gratification at the cost of our
future welfare. To no other class of persons is
it as important to say this as to girls. Many a
girl acts as if she believed that she would have
no use for any health or strength after she was
thirty years old, and so were willing to squander
all she had in a few months or years. She
should remember that she will need at least
as much each year of her threescore and ten as
she does this year. There will be people in the
future to whom she will owe obligation, just
as there are now, some of whom are yet unborn.
When we are inclined to overwork, the
same arguments should apply. Why spend
one’s self in a single effort? Why not take account
of the work that must be done in future
years? I have known short-sighted young people
who spent their entire capital of health
in getting an education, only to live thenceforth
lives of impaired usefulness.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the questions which the most conscientious
of us must constantly ask ourselves
is to what extent we should share whatever
material possessions we may have with those
less fortunate than ourselves. The needy are
all about us and the claims of suffering humanity
are insistent. The call must not fall on deaf
ears. For some this call has seemed so imperative
as to make them surrender all they had
for the sake of alleviating distress or of making
life more worth while for a few of their fellow
beings. Too many go to the other extreme
and admit no obligation to their fellow men.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here are some questions in social ethics for
you to ask yourself: Have I a right to live in
a fine house, to have expensive clothing, and
to spend money on travel and other pleasures
when there are so many people in the world
suffering for the necessities of life? To my mind
the answer is, I have a right to spend money on
myself only so far as it will make me a person
of greater value to the world. If I should give
away everything I have to those whose need is
greater than mine, and live in a hovel, only a
few out of the vast number of the needy would
be benefited and I should be unfitted to accomplish
the work in life which I am in duty bound
to accomplish. What shall we say, however, of
those who all through life are consumers and
not producers, who add nothing to the world,
but continually take from it? What further
shall we say, if, in addition to being a non-producer,
one is wasteful of that which has been
produced by others, using it for self-indulgence
and selfish pleasure? I have a friend who was
once criticized for her simple and inexpensive
clothing. Her reply was, “How can I spend
much money for clothes when there are so
many young people in the world suffering for
an education?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It seems to me, then, that loyalty to self demands
that we should regard self as nearly as
possible in an impersonal way. We must not
ask for more than our share, yet we should take
our portion just as we should expect another to
do, not for our own pleasure or selfish ambition,
but in order that we may be able to render the
largest possible service to our day and generation.
By these questions test every benefit you
seek for yourself and especially every luxury
that tempts you: Have I a <em>right</em> to this benefit
or this luxury? That is, can I take it and at the
same time be just to others? If the answer is
in the affirmative, a further question should be
asked: Will it help me to become a more valuable
person? If the answer is in the negative,
then, even though you have a right to it, your
larger privilege is to surrender that right.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c015'>X<br /> <br />THE VALUE OF DISCIPLINE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>One of the most frequent and least satisfactory
answers given to students in reply to the
question <em>why</em> a certain subject must be studied,
or a given course of conduct pursued, is, “It is
good discipline.” That statement is probably
true, but it is sometimes difficult for the questioner
to understand. He asks, What is discipline?
And why has it the virtue claimed for it?</p>

<p class='c011'>By discipline I suppose we mean the subordination
of the self to something outside of the
self, or, at least, the subordination of the self
to law, even though that law be self-made.
The psychologist could explain to you that the
law of habit is the controlling factor in all discipline.
The thing that has been done many
times is finally done with ease, is perhaps done
automatically. Ease, as some one has said, is
the lovely result of forgotten toil. The laws
that apply in learning to play the piano or to
ride a bicycle are not different from those involved
in the training of the intellect or the
will.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not necessary to point out the very evident
truth, that no school could command the
respect of its students for a single day if it
had no discipline. Whether the regulations are
made by the students themselves or by a higher
power, there must not only be subordination
of the whims and caprices of each student to
his own higher interests, but there must be subordination
of the will of each individual to the
common good. No school community could
furnish the proper conditions for growth whose
members did exactly as they pleased unless
each pleased to consider the rights of others
as sacred as his own. Whether from alien compulsion
or from some inner law, each must
make his contribution to the welfare of the
whole. The result is system and order that
enables each to go his way, free to put forth his
best effort. Each member of the community
must give up a portion of his own freedom for
the common good, that common good being for
him a much larger freedom. Students sometimes
think too much about the freedom they
surrender and not enough about the benefits
that surrender secures.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps you have sometimes for the moment
grown a little restive under discipline—who
of us has not?—and have longed for the time
when you could do just as you please. There
are, doubtless, times when even the most faithful
student longs to “play truant.” Yet holding
one’s self to definite and stated tasks is the
surest road to the largest freedom.</p>

<p class='c011'>As there is no royal road to learning, so, also,
there is none to mental insight and acumen.
You must think, compare, reason, remember.
You must learn accuracy and precision. When
the facts more or less laboriously acquired in
school and college have been for the most part
forgotten, the mind, if it has been really disciplined,
still retains the power of grappling with
new problems and solving them. This power
is worth all it costs. The value it adds to life
can hardly be overestimated. It gives an independence
and a mastery over things that
can be gained in no other way. It is the
means of providing resources that make life
vastly more worth living. It increases one’s
usefulness to the world many-fold. Such mental
training may be had, too, by most of us if
we are willing to pay the price. The majority
of people, however, are not willing to do that,
and therefore those who are generally find
themselves in positions of leadership.</p>

<p class='c011'>The training of the will is just as important
as the training of the intellect; nay, more important,
since thought is powerless until put
into action. Essential as it is that the average
citizen should be a trained thinker, even more
so is it that he be a person of right action. Yet
the two kinds of training need not be set over
against each other as if one needed to choose
between them. They should go hand in hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is difficult to say which is the source of
greater danger in a community, the weak and
nerveless will, or the strong but perverse will.
Our prisons, penitentiaries, and reform schools
are recruited for the most part from the ranks
of the weak of mind and will. In every community
the many are easily led by the few.
This is true in social life and perhaps doubly
true in political life, as we in America know to
our cost. That the perverse will may easily
grow into the wicked will, bent only on selfish
and base ends, there is constant proof in the
world about us. Such men as those designated
by a former President as “malefactors of great
wealth” belong to this class. Tyrants and despots
are made of men of strong but unregulated
will. To this class belong the overbearing and
autocratic everywhere, who always insist upon
having their own way regardless of the rights
or the feelings of others. Without fully realizing
it, many a family has among its members
one whose will rules the household, not because
it is the wisest will, but because it is the most
determined.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Man is made great or little by his will,”
said Schiller. The disciplined will has gained the
power of attention and of industry, has learned
method, accuracy, and dispatch in doing work.
It has acquired patience and perseverance and
knows how to resist, to persist, to attack and
to conquer obstacles. “My imagination would
never have served me as it has,” said Charles
Dickens, “but for the habit of commonplace,
humble, patient, daily, toiling, drudging attention.”
“Genius,” said George Eliot, “is a vast
capacity for receiving discipline.” If even the
great writers admit, as many of them do, that
their work is the result of long and patient self-discipline,
surely in the more ordinary walks of
life that kind of training may not be despised.</p>

<p class='c011'>To have a work that we love is one of the
supreme things to be desired in life. It must
be admitted, however, that the majority of the
world’s workers find little pleasure in their task.
Yet the next best thing to doing one’s work
with enjoyment is to <em>do</em> it—even without
enjoyment. This takes strength of will, more
strength of will, indeed, than many possess.
This is one of the reasons (though not the only
one) why there are always and everywhere so
many persons out of employment. The number
of such persons who have to be taken care
of by the charity of the State, simply because
they cannot or will not hold themselves to
labor of any kind, is appalling.</p>

<p class='c011'>But even the most favored of us, congenial
though our work may be, have duties to perform
every day that are not especially pleasurable.
A few years ago Dr. Eliot, then President of
Harvard College, addressed a body of laboring
men on “The Joy of Labor.” He tried to show
them that they should not expect pleasure in
every detail of their work, but rather in seeing
its larger relationships, and in working toward
a certain definite goal. He said that among the
men of his acquaintance, those whose work
seemed to him most enviable had much to do
in the course of each day that could by no
means be called pleasurable and that had to be
done by sheer effort of will. The men whom
he was addressing, he remarked, probably
regarded his own work as wholly delightful;
yet that was by no means the case, as the larger
part of each day’s work was drudgery, and his
joy in doing it came only through realizing its
importance in the scheme of the whole. It is
the disciplined will which enables us to do the
disagreeable or the uninteresting thing uncomplainingly.
The scientist at work in his laboratory,
the lawyer preparing his brief, the business
man toiling by day and often by night in
his office, give most of their time to uninteresting
details. Yet the difference between success
and failure usually lies in one’s ability or lack
of ability to hold himself to uninspiring details.</p>

<p class='c011'>Does the mother who has the care of a family
need a disciplined will? Who, indeed, needs
it more? In whose life is there more of petty
detail and unending drudgery? Where is there
greater need of the wide outlook and the large
vision? In this case it is the vision of a perfect
home which glorifies the petty details and the
drudgery.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Who sweeps a room as for thy laws</div>
      <div class='line'>Makes that and the action fine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The person of disciplined will has learned to
respect the rights of others. English people
often comment on the lack of discipline in a
certain type of American home, with its self-asserting
children who ignore the rights of their
elders. These children, grown up into young
men and women, trample on the rights and on
the feelings of others. The spoiled girl who goes
away from home to live the community life in
school or college can quickly be distinguished
from her more fortunate fellow students who
have behind them years of the firm and kindly
discipline of a wise home. She is obliged to
adjust herself to the new conditions, where her
rights are of no more importance than those
of any one else. She must put herself under
prompt and severe discipline if she is to win for
herself any place in the school or college world.
If she fails to do this, she must pay the penalty.
Until she can be an acceptable member of the
community, she can have but small share in
its life. One of the best reasons why every girl
should receive a part of her schooling away
from home is because of the wholesome discipline
sure to be administered by her fellow
students.</p>

<p class='c011'>The athletic field is one of the best places in
the world for discipline. Self-subordination to
the good of the whole forms the basis of success
in every game. Good “team-work” admits of
no bumptiousness on the part of any player.
No good, clean game is ever played without its
lessons in self-restraint and self-control.</p>

<p class='c011'>A trained and disciplined will you will find
to be your most valuable resource, enabling
you to do the thing that ought to be done and
to do it when it ought to be done, whether you
like it or not. Is not this power the greatest
asset possessed by those who have achieved
true success in every age? In these days, when
learning is so often sugar-coated and made
attractive by every possible device, it is well to
emphasize this point. It seems to be the aim
of some teachers—indeed, of some schools of
education—to administer the greatest amount
of knowledge with the least amount of effort
on the part of the pupil. Every device and
every method which deprives a pupil of doing
his own thinking is harmful. The more genuine
effort put forth the better. We all know that
the quick pupil who learns without effort is
often surpassed later in life by the plodding,
hard-working pupil. One reason is that the
latter was forced to acquire while young those
habits of industry and perseverance which are
the price of success.</p>

<p class='c011'>A wise sprinkling of electives is a great improvement
upon the iron-clad course of study
of a generation ago. I certainly would not be
understood as saying that it is better to study
without enjoyment than with enjoyment, for I
strongly believe the opposite. There is a tendency
among students, however, in selecting a
course of study to follow the lines of least resistance.
I would almost advise a student to
go to the other extreme. Remembering my
own student days and the feeling of joy and
mastery that came from conquering some particularly
difficult subject in an inflexible course
of study, I should give every student the opportunity
occasionally to measure himself against
a subject that is especially hard for him. It
strengthens the sinews of the mind. It breeds
confidence and power. Can you not remember
some occasion when you mastered some especially
difficult problem or subject, and can you
not still feel the exhilaration that came with
that mastery? You became suddenly conscious
of new power, you could feel yourself grow.
Then how can you believe that you are being
educated if your work is not of such a nature as
to call forth your highest powers? In regard
to the tendency of students in schools and colleges
to choose “snap courses,” Dean Briggs
says, “For any responsible work we want men
of character—not men who from childhood
up have been personally conducted and have
had their education warped to the indolence of
their minds.” The attitude of mind which is
satisfied merely with a passing grade is most
unscholarly and betrays low ideals. One who is
so satisfied has missed the conception of what
education really is.</p>

<p class='c011'>In life, as most of us quickly find out, one
of the most important things we have to do is
to overcome obstacles. They beset every path
and either they must yield or we must. Life is
not intended to be easy for any of us. Sometimes
we meet persons who give us the impression
of being able to conquer any situation
or any combination of circumstances in which
they may be placed. Whatever they undertake,
we know they will carry it through in
spite of obstacles. Such people inspire confidence
wherever they go. We instinctively feel
that they may safely be entrusted with large
things. Julia Ward Howe used to say that she
never dared to remark to her husband, Dr.
Howe, that anything was impossible, for he
would go straight off and do it!</p>

<p class='c011'>I wonder if it was not the discipline in the soldier’s
life which made the early apostles speak
so often of the Christian life in terms of warfare.
Certainly there is nothing else in war
that could have appealed to them. The soldier
is the embodiment of discipline. He
who would command others must first learn to
obey. It is through obedience, discipline, that
we come to authority. The first claim to a position
of leadership in the world is complete
mastery of one’s self.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c015'>XI<br /> <br />THE SUCCESSFUL LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We may not all agree upon a definition of
success, but we shall all agree that whatever it
is, we want it; that, indeed, we want it more
than anything else in the world. How to secure
it is what all the colleges and schools are trying
to teach and what all the ministers in all the
churches are preaching. If you knew you would
sometime have to look back, realizing that you
had made a failure of life, you would hardly
care to go on living. Many do have this experience.
Such a person seems like a disabled vessel
being towed into port with broken mast and
damaged rigging. Yet that person was once
young and hopeful, with life all before him, and
he looked forward to something so different!
Sometimes we fail to realize that the very purpose
of our school days is to get us ready for the
voyage; that we are day by day being taught
the use of chart and compass; that we are being
shown where the danger lies and where the
safe paths are to be found.</p>

<p class='c011'>If you want to know how you can secure for
your own life and character those qualities
which you most covet, study the lives of those
who have these qualities and try to compel
them to yield you their secret. As I think, one
after another, of the most successful lives of
which I have read in history, I find that there
are certain characteristics that all seem to
have possessed in common. Take a dozen or a
score of really successful lives chosen at random
and make them a subject of earnest study and
comparison. In outward circumstances and
conditions of life you will find these lives widely
at variance. One person has been a child of fortune
and another has had the severest struggle
with poverty. One bears an honored name
with generations of culture, character, and
achievement behind it; another is of obscure
origin, with little help from family or early environment.
The ends accomplished in life have
been as different as the means of accomplishing
them; yet in all worthy lives there are certain
clearly defined and common characteristics.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first place, I think that all the successful
people whom I have known or known of
have had a definite purpose in life. I see them
keeping right on, striving for a certain goal, regardless
of enticements by the way. The able
mariner knows to what port he is bound. He
does not keep changing his course, he does
not become disheartened and drift with every
chance wind. Unswervingly he steers toward
the goal he has in view. Many of the failures
in life are caused by purposelessness.</p>

<p class='c011'>None of these persons whom I have classed
among the successful seem to have been seeking
pleasure. They have been possessed by great
ideas, they have been occupied with large
thoughts, they have been devoted to the good
of others, to the advancement of mankind.
Can you imagine a Lincoln or a Phillips Brooks
wrapped up in his own petty concerns, even for
a day? The self-centered life is a failure. “He
that is greatest among you, let him be the
servant of all.” All really successful lives have
been moulded on that principle. Such men and
women have not cared especially about being
great or famous, but how they have longed to
serve! There are thousands of unhappy persons
who might find happiness and the beginning
of success if they would only stop asking
whether they are happy and would go and do
something for somebody.</p>

<p class='c011'>All really successful people have <em>faith</em>. They
have faith in themselves, faith in their fellow
men, and faith in God. It is difficult to see how
any life can be strong without such faith.</p>

<p class='c011'>We must have faith in ourselves because we
are likely never to accomplish more than we
believe we can accomplish. It is not always
modesty on our part to shrink from an undertaking
because of our unworthiness; sometimes
it is weakness. “Self-trust is the essence of
heroism,” said Carlyle. This does not mean
that there is no such thing as over-confidence
in self. We have all known people who over-estimated
their own powers. The conceited
person is rightly considered a nuisance and a
subject of ridicule. The person who is always
attempting some great project which ends in a
fiasco is deserving of the condemnation which he
receives. Yet most failures are caused by too
little confidence in self rather than too much.
Our consciousness of weakness ought to be
accompanied by a belief in our power to overcome
that weakness. The self-distrust which
hinders growth becomes a moral wrong. Those
who accomplish large things usually have a
splendid self-confidence which is as far removed
as possible from self-conceit. It is said
of Mary Lyon, by one of her biographers, that
she had “the rare power of distinguishing
between the impossible and the merely difficult.”
That is a power we should all cultivate.</p>

<p class='c011'>One thing that should be impressed upon
young people, who have not yet had sufficient
experience to make the discovery for themselves,
is that we have a right to judge ourselves
by the best of which we are capable, not
by the worst. There is an ebb and flow of the
tides of the spirit. We have our moods of depression
and of exaltation. One of sensitive
conscience is quite likely to believe that his
worst self is his real self. That is not true. This
conflict among the many selves that each of us
feels crowding for utterance within him is well
expressed by one of our minor poets:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Within my earthly temple there’s a crowd;</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s one of us that’s humble, one that’s proud.</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s one that loves his neighbor as himself</div>
      <div class='line'>And one that cares for naught but fame and pelf.</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s one that’s broken-hearted for his sins</div>
      <div class='line'>And one that unrepentant sits and grins.</div>
      <div class='line'>From much corroding care I should be free</div>
      <div class='line'>If once I could determine which is me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In seeking to determine which of this motley
crowd is really you, one thing should be clear,
your real self is what you are in your highest
moments. Do not accept as yourself the one
who cares for fame and pelf, but the one who
loves his neighbor as himself; not the unrepentant
one, but the one who is broken-hearted for
his sins. Life really is what it looks to us to be
when we are on the heights, not when we are in
the valley. When belief in our own possibilities
is greatest, that is the time when our vision is
truest; for the first step in realizing those possibilities
is to believe in them. The vision of our
best selves, of our highest possibilities, which
we had on the heights, must be carried down
into the valleys, there to furnish us inspiration
and impetus.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But tasks in hours of insight willed</div>
      <div class='line'>Can be through hours of gloom fulfilled.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>If you would be really successful you must
have faith in your fellow men. No doubtful or
suspicious person was ever a benefactor of his
race. The person who can help you most is the
one who has most faith in you. So if you would
help others, you must have faith in them. The
power to see the best in a person in spite of his
faults is a precious power. If you have it not,
cultivate it. Never look for a mean motive in
another. Always recognize the germ of goodness,
small though it be, and always help it to
grow. Nothing inspires us like the knowledge
that some one expects good things of us.</p>

<p class='c011'>By believing in people we make them believe
in themselves. There is no greater service we
can render our fellow men than to increase
their faith in themselves and in their own
powers. To be a faith-inspirer is a privilege
we should all earnestly covet. We all know
people from whose presence we come away
feeling that all things are possible. They encourage
us, they stimulate us, they compel us
to believe in ourselves. This rare and precious
power belongs only to those whose lives are
fed from deep spiritual sources. To be a faith-inspirer
one’s own attitude toward life must be
right; one must be in tune with one’s self. The
very atmosphere about such a person is charged
with hope and cheer. No pessimist, no cynic,
no misanthrope was ever a faith-inspirer. The
possession of this quality depends not upon
what we <em>do</em>, but upon what we <em>are</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some people, as they grow older and meet
with more or less selfishness and deceit, as we
all do, grow cynical. They conclude that there
is no such thing as honor or constancy or disinterested
kindness. Cling with undying faith
to your belief in the goodness of human nature.
Has some one deceived you? In spite of that,
be just as ready to trust again.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Better trust all and be deceived,</div>
      <div class='line'>And weep that trust and that deceiving.</div>
      <div class='line'>Than doubt one heart that, if believed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had blessed one’s life with true believing.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It would be difficult to find any one who
has had real success in life and yet does not
believe in God. How can I keep my own life
serene and hopeful if I believe that the world
is ruled only by blind chance, that there is no
meaning or purpose in life, that wrong may
eventually triumph over right? But belief in
a wise and beneficent Ruler of the universe
should be the greatest element of strength in
my own life; it should give me assurance that
the forces of the universe are in league with
righteousness and that good will finally triumph
over evil.</p>

<p class='c011'>What a comfort it is to believe, when the
forces of evil seem to be in the ascendant, that
it is only for a moment! Perhaps you are troubled
because justice does not always seem to be
done in the world. You know that the wicked
often prosper and the righteous suffer, and perhaps
you are troubled to understand why.
Doubtless this is not easy to comprehend
fully, but far better than comprehension is the
acceptance of it in the right spirit and as a
part of the divine plan. We all need a working
theory of life, a philosophy of life, if you will, or
we cannot live strong lives. One who has faith
in “that Power not ourselves that makes for
righteousness” can be optimistic and serene,
and can believe that things everywhere are
gradually working themselves out for good.
No matter what happens, such persons never
believe that the world is going to destruction.
Even the most cruel and needless war since
time began cannot shake their faith that the
world is gradually getting better and that it
will continue to grow better. When they stand
for the right, it is in the confidence that they
are fighting on God’s side and that in the end
He is always victorious.</p>

<p class='c011'>I believe there is such a thing as a habit of
success. Some people have the habit, and you
can hardly imagine them anywhere in this
world or any other where they would not be
winning successes. Why? Because of two
things, high purpose and an indomitable will.
Given both, what can defeat us? “The day is
his who works in it with serenity and great
aims.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Failure will come sometimes, to be sure, as
it comes to all. But what of that? The
indomitable spirit will still urge us on. Browning held
that “we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better.”
So holds every brave, strong soul. This is
what I call <em>the habit of success</em>. That attitude
toward life, which in a failure or a defeat finds
only a lesson for the next time, is sure to win.</p>

<p class='c011'>My definition of success, you will see, does
not take large account of wealth or position
or fame, or of many other things some people
foolishly think spell success. One who has
mastered the fine art of living has had real
success, whether or not the world ever hears of
him. Do not think that the success of one’s life
is to be measured by the amount of pleasure in
it. Some are fortunate all the days of their
lives, with good health, sufficient means, and
kind friends. Others have trouble after trouble
heaped upon them, poverty, ill-health, and
grief. We are likely, if we are not discerning, to
think that one has failed of success when he has
only been roughly buffeted by fate. We have
to know the soul to know whether or not one
has been a success. We have to know what God
thinks of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>What are the school days for unless they are
to teach you values, to show you which things
are of most worth? The same qualities which
bring success in after life are needed in one’s
preparation for life. Opportunities lie all about,
unnoticed and neglected by some, by others
seized and employed to their full. Side by side
sit two students, one dull and listless or dissipating
the energies of the mind in a thousand ways;
the other earnest, alert to seize every opportunity
for self-improvement. Later in life the two
move on, one failing in everything he undertakes
because of these same habits of indifference
and indolence; the other applying his
concentrated powers to the task in hand and
winning victory. Success in life is not greatly
a matter of opportunity, it is rather a matter
of character.</p>

  <h2 id='chXII' class='c015'>XII<br /> <br />THE PROGRESS OF WOMAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Of all the wonders which the history of civilization
presents to us, especially during the
past century, by far the most remarkable is the
progress of woman. Just as we teach the story
of political and religious freedom to the rising
generation, in order that the blessings of civil
and religious liberty may be more fully prized
and guarded, so all girls and women should be
taught something of the long, arduous struggle
which women have had in order to reach the
position which they now occupy in the most
enlightened parts of the earth. Though a painful
struggle, its history is instructive and stimulating.
If we know what public opinion has
been in the past regarding woman’s place in the
world, we can more truly decide whether or
not present-day tendencies are to persist.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is so easy for the unthinking to assume
that the world is as it was intended to be and
that the customs and conventionalities of society
are divinely ordained. This is one of the
reasons why we should be careful students of
history. No one who has the wide point of
view which such study gives can fail to recognize
the fact that ours is by no means a completed
world, but that evolution is as surely in
progress now as ever it was, and that human
society is still in the making. Each generation
is in duty bound to know the accumulated wisdom
of past ages and to add something to it for
future generations.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are many phases of the so-called
“woman-question,” the enfranchisement of woman
being only one of them, though the one
we are hearing most about to-day. All the
questions which have arisen, and all which are
likely to arise in the future, may be summed
up in one or two all-important questions: Is
there any freedom, privilege, or opportunity
accounted good for men that should be denied
to women? If so, to whom belongs the right
to deny it?</p>

<p class='c011'>Within the last few years many conventional
ideas regarding woman’s sphere have been
swept away and still others are disappearing.
While the discussion is going on, sometimes
with heat and bitterness, but sometimes calmly
and sanely, a generation of girls is growing up,
each one of whom is vitally concerned. In
what sort of a world are these girls soon to
take their places? To what extent are the duties
and responsibilities of woman to be different
from what they have been? The girl of to-day,
who is to be the woman of to-morrow, should
come into this new world open-eyed and intelligent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only a few hundred years ago philosophers
were seriously debating the question whether
or not women have souls. With the passing of
the centuries an attitude of mind so extraordinary
was no longer possible, but other ideas,
which are not much less amazing in the light
of to-day, long persisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>The literature of any age reflects current
public opinion, and if we would know how
women were regarded and what qualities were
thought most desirable in them, all we need
do is read the literature of that period. Euripides
reflects Greek sentiment when he makes
Iphigenia say to Achilles, “Better a thousand
women should perish than one man cease to
see the light.” The Latin motto, <em>Bene vixit
qui bene latuit</em> (“She has lived well who has
kept well concealed”), speaks eloquently of
woman’s place in the days of the Roman Empire.
In the metrical romances of the
mediæval period, women seem to live only to grace
a tournament or to furnish opportunity for a
feat of chivalry on the part of some knight-errant.
In Chaucer’s time such stories as that
of Patient Griselda force us to the conclusion
that she was the most highly esteemed woman
who patiently endured the grossest injustice
and the most cruel wrong. The weak and
sentimental women of Fielding, Richardson,
and other eighteenth-century novelists call
forth our pity when we realize the purposeless
lives they were expected to lead. We must not
overlook the fact, however, that in every age
there have been marked exceptions to the general
rule. From the time of Deborah, or long
before, each age has had its “new women,”
its nonconformists, who insisted upon doing
their own thinking. Most of Shakespeare’s
heroines are of this type.</p>

<p class='c011'>From time immemorial laws have rested
heavily upon women. This is true of the Roman
law, so just and fair in most respects.
Woman was not a citizen with the rights and
privileges of a citizen; she was in a state of
perpetual tutelage. We do not, however, have
to go back to Roman times to find unjust discrimination
against women. In this country
Connecticut was the first State to give women
the power to make a will, which it did only one
hundred years ago. It is not long since a law
was enacted in Massachusetts giving women a
legal right to their own clothing. It took a terrible
tragedy only a few years ago, the killing
of a number of innocent children by their half-crazed
mother lest they fall into the hands of
their unworthy father, to cause the Massachusetts
Legislature to abolish the law which made
the father the sole guardian of his children.</p>

<p class='c011'>In those parts of the world where the Christian
religion is little known, the progress of
women has been even slower and beset with
more obstacles than in Christendom. Indeed,
the women of those countries must look to
Christian lands for their salvation. Buddhism,
the principal religion of Japan, teaches that
woman’s only hope of heaven is that she may
be reincarnated as a man. Confucius, the
founder of the religion that prevails in China,
taught that ten daughters do not equal the
value of one son. The woman of Brahminic
faith is forbidden to read the scriptures or to
offer prayer in her own right. We all know
something of the horror of the suttee in India,
which, until prohibited by English law,
permitted a widow to be sacrificed on her husband’s
funeral pyre. The Moslem man prays,
“O God, I thank thee that thou hast not made
me a woman,” and the Koran teaches that
strict obedience to her husband is the only
condition upon which a woman can be saved.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fact that so few women have attained a
supreme place in any art or profession is often
brought forward to prove the natural inferiority
of women. When we recall how few men
attain the first rank in spite of the honors and
rewards showered by an approving world upon
such a man, and when we remember that until
recently it was considered hardly respectable
for a woman to write a book, to paint a picture,
or even to publish music, the surprising thing
is that so many women have defied public opinion
and have given expression to the genius
that was in them. George Eliot wrote under the
name of a man in order to get a hearing. The
rich poetic gifts of Dorothy Wordsworth largely
increased the fame of her illustrious brother.
No one knows how many of Felix Mendelssohn’s
beautiful “Songs without Words” were
the work of his sister Fanny, as we are told
by his recent biographers. Caroline Herschel
was another gifted sister whose labors helped
bring honor and fame to her brother, the great
astronomer. If any of these women had lived
in the twentieth century, the world would have
paid them high honor for the work of their
gifted minds.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last half of the nineteenth century
brought educational opportunity to women and
the inevitable result followed: they began to
reason and hence to ask their share of things,
and it looks as if they would not stop until
they get it. What are they asking? That all
artificial barriers to their freedom be removed,
nothing more. So far as nature has created
barriers for them and placed limitations upon
them, these barriers and limitations should
be respected, must be respected. With these,
reasonable women have no quarrel. It is
the artificially made barriers they are determined
to remove. The Chinese woman is realizing
that she has burdens sufficiently heavy to
bear without adding that of an artificial deformity.
Life will not be any too easy for the
feminine half of the race even when they have
obtained every right and every opportunity
to which they have a claim.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the things which women asked in
vain for many years was the privilege of higher
educational opportunity. One hundred years
ago there was not a single college in our country
which opened its doors to women. All
the arguments which are put forward against
the enfranchisement of women to-day were
put forward yesterday against the extension
of their educational opportunities. Serious-minded
and earnest men—and women, too—argued
that women had no use for the higher
education; that they were not capable of receiving
it, and that if some, by chance, were
equal to it intellectually, they were not physically.
The final and seemingly unanswerable
argument was that education would unfit women
for the sacred duties of the home. Now
that our colleges are graduating more than ten
thousand young women every year who have
not lost their health and who make better wives
and mothers because of their wider horizon
and broader interests, no one remembers these
foolish fears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another privilege which women have been
seeking for many years is the opportunity to
work; that is, they have been asking that there
be no artificial barriers between them and the
work they want to do. The world is yielding
them this privilege, though slowly and
somewhat grudgingly. We are still told occasionally
that woman is out of her place whenever she
seeks remunerative employment outside of the
home. It makes little difference, however, who
approves and who disapproves. To put things
back to where they were one hundred years ago
would be no less difficult than to turn back
Niagara River. Statistics tell us that there are
at present over eight million women in this
country engaged in gainful occupations.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps you ask, But why do women rush
out into the world to find work? Why can we
not go back to the good old times when all
women found shelter and safety within the
walls of the home? The answer to this question
is a very complex one. More than fifty years
ago Harriet Martineau wrote of conditions in
England, “A social organization framed for a
community of which half stayed at home while
the other half went out to work cannot answer
the purposes of a society of which a quarter remains
at home while three quarters go out to
work. With this new condition of affairs, new
duties and new views must be adopted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is wide disagreement as to the answer
to the question why so many women are
engaged in gainful employments. You can best
work out the problem for yourself by recalling
the women and girls of your acquaintance who
are earning a livelihood by work outside of the
home. Ask one of these why she does not give
up her present position and go back to the
“shelter of the home.” She will probably tell
you that there is in her home no possible means
of support for her. The chances are that she
will tell you that her labor is one of the sources
of income for the maintenance of that home
and dependent ones in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The talk of some people would lead you to
think that if women would only behave themselves
they might all spend their lives in weaving
and spinning, as their great-grandmothers did.
But if they did this there would be no market
for their labors; and who would earn the money
necessary for their support? If you knew the
facts in regard to the average home of one
hundred years ago, you would find conditions
vastly different from what they are now. Then,
the great bulk of the population lived on farms,
from which the labor of all drew sustenance
for all. For many years the trend of population
has been toward the cities, and the man
who once made a comfortable living from the
farm, with the assistance of his family, now
works in a store or a factory or some other industrial
concern. The compensation is often not
enough for the family necessities, and the labor
of women must be added to that of men. Formerly
there were few men who did not have
several dependent women relatives in addition
to wife and daughters. Now a self-respecting
woman prefers the independence which comes
with self-support.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, a great deal of the most interesting
work has been forced out of the home.
Labor-saving inventions have multiplied and
every year brings new ones. Thus have the
forces of water and air and electricity conspired
to take away much of the ancient prerogative
of woman. Your great-grandmother,
in all probability, made all the clothing for her
family, men included. Moreover, she and her
assistants wove the cloth and her hands spun
the wool out of which it was made. The linen
and the wool must still be woven and made
into cloth, but it must be done outside of the
home. One would almost have to be wealthy
now in order to wear garments toward which
no machine had made any contribution. The
Ruskin weaving industries of England are an
example of the handwork of the twentieth
century, but the textiles made on those looms
are costly.</p>

<p class='c011'>In your great-grandmother’s home were
manufactured all the lights needed, the wax
or tallow candles. We now demand gas and
electricity. Then all the food consumed in the
home was prepared there. Now vast canneries
and factories do the work at less cost than it
can be done in the home. Ready-made clothing
can often be bought as cheaply as the
materials alone for home manufacture.</p>

<p class='c011'>What I wish to show is that the transference
of the labor of the home to the factory has
robbed many women of useful, satisfying labor.
This has produced widespread unrest among
them. The protest against inactivity has caused
an increasing army of women to knock upon
the door of every opportunity for productive,
satisfying occupation.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not a wrong instinct in women which
urges them, when not needed in the home, to
find activity outside of it. If you have a craving
to do something in the world, don’t be
ashamed of it. It may not be best for you to
do it, but the wish to do it does not prove that
you are unwomanly, even if it is something that
has oftenest been done by men. I am always
glad when I find a girl seriously taking up some
line of work by means of which she may, if
necessary, gain a livelihood. Is it wise for
parents to bring their daughters up without
any definite aim, instilling into their minds the
idea that they will always be taken care of
and protected? Who is protected, who can be
protected, when fortunes are heaped up to-day
only to be swept away to-morrow?</p>

<p class='c011'>In the progress of women, it is the question
of their enfranchisement which is particularly
agitating the world to-day, just as, yesterday,
it was the question of their education. We
have no right not to be interested in the matter.
The statement may fearlessly be made that
there is not an American young woman alive
to-day upon whom will not fall, if she lives
to a reasonable age, the responsibility of the
ballot. You may believe in woman suffrage
or you may not, yet, with your consent or
without it, there will some time be placed in
your hands an instrument for the possession
of which men struggled and fought for hundreds
of years, and for which many of them
died; and for which women have struggled
since long before you were born, and for which
many of them would have been willing to die.
The danger is that when woman suffrage shall
have become universal, and we are no longer
reminded, as we now constantly are, of the
cost and the value of the ballot, we shall cease
to prize it, and shall grow careless of its use, as
many men also have done. That is the way of
the world. What one generation purchases at
tremendous cost, the next accepts as a matter
of course. A distinguished woman, who, though
she labored hard to help secure higher educational
privileges for women, was born a little
too soon to avail herself of them, gave an illustration
of this. Her granddaughter, just home
on her first vacation from college, said to her,
“Grandmother, I wonder that you did not
go to college. It is splendid!” How little that
girl knew of the long, uphill struggle that had
taken place in order that she might receive a
college education!</p>

<p class='c011'>Why are women asking for an opportunity
to vote? Whatever arguments may be adduced
in favor of woman suffrage, we always come
back to equality as a first principle, the primary
right of each individual to claim before the law
the same right as every other individual. It is
not entirely a question of the wise use of suffrage,
it is a question of liberty and equality.
As the world has become more enlightened,
liberty has more and more become its governing
principle, and the progress cannot stop
until every adult fitted for citizenship in any
civilized state shall be enfranchised.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here are several reasons why, it seems to
me, women should have the ballot.</p>

<p class='c011'>First, in order that they may feed and clothe
their families properly and provide healthful
homes for them to live in. The preparation of
food used to be solely women’s business, but
it is not now, as I have said. Upon proper
inspection of dairies, bakeries, canneries, etc.,
every family depends for its well-being. Adulteration
of food and misbranding need to be
guarded against. We all know something of the
struggle that has been waged for years by the
Consumers’ League and other beneficent agencies
against the sweat-shop system. Poisonous
germs may lurk in a garment made under
unwholesome conditions. A polluted water-supply
or a defective sewage system may bring
disease or death into any home. The ballot is
not the only weapon which can be employed
against these evils that menace the home, but
it is probably the most effective one.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another reason why women should vote is
for the sake of the moral welfare of their
children. It is the voter who has it in his hands
to eliminate the saloon and to control the public
dance-hall, the debasing theater or moving-picture
show, and other sources of moral corruption.
It is the voter who has the power to
establish libraries and art galleries, playgrounds
and parks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Women ought to vote for the sake of protecting
and helping those who cannot help
themselves; for the sake of abolishing child-labor,
and of securing humane hours and reasonable
wages for working-women as well as
better protection for young girls against those
who would ensnare them. They should vote,
also, in order that they may have a voice in
measures affecting the public welfare, such as
old-age pensions, mothers’ pensions, industrial
insurance, prison reform, better care of the sick
and the aged, and all forms of civic betterment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Women should vote in order that they may
help to abolish unjust discrimination against
women. Even in this free Republic many steps
will have to be taken before women will have
the same rights before the law as men. The
enfranchisement of women will hasten that
time. It is only a few years since Senator
Tillman, of South Carolina, called to his aid
an ancient law of that State in order to enable
his son, who had left his wife, to take their children
from her. South Carolina is not the only
State in which the law, in case of a legal separation,
is most unjust to the woman. According
to a recent authority, women have the
same rights as men in the guardianship of
their children in only sixteen States of the
Union. In some States the father has even
power to deed the children away from their
mother. In a number of the States of the
Union, the husband still has legal control of
his wife’s property and he may claim her wages.
Every woman should resolve to do all in her
power to help to abolish such obviously unjust
laws as these.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is one more reason why women should
vote, and that is, for their own growth and
enlargement. Only a few hundred years ago
woman had practically no liberty. She had
little freedom before marriage, small choice
in marriage, unequal rights as a wife, no legal
right to her children. She could own no property;
educational opportunities were denied
her; and her life from birth to death was determined
by others, not by herself. One has
only to read such a story as Browning’s “The
Ring and the Book” to understand something
of the wrongs that millions of women suffered
before the days when the world in the process
of evolution was brought to a more enlightened
idea of the rights of woman. What vast
progress she has made! One who knows the
story of it can be patient in regard to further
progress, confident that it will come as surely as
the planets will continue in their orbits. And
we must not forget that at every step upward
hands of strong and fearless men have been held
out to her, else she could not have reached her
present position. That person is doing small
service to the world who attempts to set the
interests of women over against those of men
and to create antagonism between them. Let
us never forget that their interests are not opposed
to each other, but that in the long run
nothing can be detrimental to one which is not
also detrimental to the other.</p>

  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c015'>XIII<br /> <br />SOURCES OF HAPPINESS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You do not need to be reminded of the importance
of this subject. Do we not hear on
all sides that happiness is what all the world
is seeking? Why are men toiling and struggling
and warring with each other to heap up
wealth except that they believe it will bring happiness?
It is probably true that most of the
actions of the majority of human beings are
directed, consciously or unconsciously, toward
happiness as an end. “We keep pleasure in
the background of our minds, not allowing it to
be seen, yet always hoping for more and more
of it,” says one of our modern writers on ethics.
Yet I should be sorry to have you believe that
pleasure is the <em>summum bonum</em> of life.</p>

<p class='c011'>All normal, healthy young people are happy.
There may be disappointments and sorrows,
but the power of rebound is great and happiness
returns. The Creator evidently wants us to be
happy, and any other theory of life is an unnatural
one. The ascetics of the Middle Ages
had a mistaken idea of serving God, believing
that the more they suffered, the better they
were pleasing Him. Our conception of God as
a God of love forbids that theory. In children
and animals happiness is always a sign of
well-being, as it seems to denote absence of
ill-adjustment. If a young child appears to be
happy, we feel that all is well with it. The
frolicsome play of all young creatures is an
expression of the gladness that has been implanted
within them. The further removed we
are from the spirit of gladness, the less are we
conforming to one of the deepest laws of our
being.</p>

<p class='c011'>Happiness is good, not only as a sign that
all is well with us, just as silence in the machine
denotes perfect adjustment, but it is
good as productive of something beyond itself.
If we are happy, we work better. Happiness
has an exhilarating effect. If we are happy,
we add to the joy of all about us and thus
increase the gladness of the world. Happiness
is not only the sign of absence of friction, it
removes friction. It is not only an indication
of health, but a cause of health. One who
enjoys his dinner will digest it better than one
who eats from duty. If happiness is, then, so
important, we may reasonably ask what we can
do to secure it.</p>

<p class='c011'>We may rightly say that we want all the
happiness we can have consistent with other
aims. A wrong attitude regarding it is that we
must purchase it at any cost, no matter how
much we have to ride over the rights of others
to secure it. This is the attitude of many
young people who have been brought up in
affluence and who have formed the fatal habit
of thinking that life must bring them whatever
they want. One longs to say to such young
people that happiness does not depend upon
what we have, but upon what we are. The
person who is discontented in a hovel would
be discontented in a palace, for even there he
would have to live with himself. Mrs. Wiggs
could not have been happier in a mansion than
she was in her cabbage-patch, because her
happiness was independent of external things.
She made it herself by her attitude toward the
world, toward her work, toward her troubles
and her blessings. Those, however, who are
of an unhappy, discontented nature always
attribute their lack of happiness to some definite
thing or things which their more fortunate
friends have and the possession of which they
think would bring complete happiness. In the
expressive words of George Eliot, “Dissatisfaction
seeks a definite object and finds it in
the privation of an untried good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Happiness is never won by direct pursuit.
Just when she seems so close that we are sure
we can reach out the hand and grasp her, she
is gone, and again we must start in hot pursuit.
Many have spent their lives in this way, a
bootless chase. It is only when we give up this
mad pursuit and attend to our business in life
that Happiness comes and makes her home with
us. “Pleasure to be got must be forgot.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But you are happy, so why talk to you
about securing something which you already
possess, indeed, have never been without?
Because there are many kinds of happiness,
some far more satisfying and more permanent
than others. It is for us to see to it
that ours is of a kind that will stand every
test. At your stage of life you possess most of
the blessings which the world has always regarded
as most desirable. If you wish to count
them you may begin with youth. To be young
means that almost all of life is before you and
that no irrevocable mistakes have as yet been
made. There are many with misspent lives
behind them, who would barter everything
they possess for youth and the opportunity to
begin all over again. You possess health. What
would not the aged and feeble, the crippled,
the diseased, give for your vigorous body! Like
most of our truest riches, however, health is
something we take as a matter of course and
do not know the value of until it has departed
from us. You have human love. Whoever
you are there are those whose world is made
brighter because of your presence in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Youth, health, love are yours, so why should
you not be happy? But I have already said
that you are happy. And yet I did not quite
mean it. I should probably do you no injustice
if I should say that you are not as happy as
this splendid trio of blessings would seem to
warrant. The reason is that real happiness
does not come as a gift. It is achieved happiness
that is of most worth.</p>

<p class='c011'>You have often been told, no doubt, that the
school days are the happiest days of life. Some
men and women of maturer years are very fond
of preaching this doctrine to young people.
But it is a wrong and pernicious theory of life,
and those who advocate it condemn themselves
by their own words, for they show that they
have lacked the power to make life richer and
deeper as it went on. “I never will believe,”
says George Eliot, “that our youngest days are
our happiest. What a miserable augury for the
progress of the race and the destination of the
individual if the more matured and enlightened
state is the less happy one!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Getting to the end of school days is not,
then, like walking off a precipice. There is
much beyond and it is good. To be sure, there
will be no more days just like the school days,
with their freedom from care, their glorious
comradeship, and their stimulus to high endeavor.
In future years they doubtless will
wear a halo possessed by no others, but this
will not mean that they were really the happiest.
In fact, if the first twenty years of one’s
life have truly prepared one to live, life should
constantly grow richer as it moves onward.
We should grow happier as we grow older because
of two things, increasing power of service,
and a growing capacity for enjoyment. Dr.
Eliot, ex-President of Harvard University, once
defined education as “increasing the capacity
for serviceableness and for enjoyment.” In
this sense education does not stop with the
school days. Each year should reveal new
springs of power and should develop within us
new resources. Women ought to be even more
careful than men to develop such powers and
resources, for a man’s active life in the world
is much more likely to compel growth in him.
How many women there are who, after reaching
middle life, when their children are grown
up and gone out of the home, find it impossible
to secure happy employment for the mind!
They might have developed resources and
powers which would have given them an ever-increasing
interest in life.</p>

<p class='c011'>We often hear people wish for childhood or
youth again. When any one expresses such a
wish, he generally means that he would like
to be a child or youth again if he could take
back with him all the wisdom and all the
powers and capacities that the years have
brought him in exchange for his vanished
youth. But to be a child again, just such a
child as he was, and to grow up all over again,
making the same unhappy blunders and suffering
from the same hard knocks in the process
of adjustment to an inexorable universe—who
would wish it? As a matter of fact, if we are
really wise, we shall never wish that we might
repeat any period of life. Always, just beyond
and beckoning to us, is the next period, and
we should always believe with Browning that
“the best is yet to be.” No period of life has
or can have a monopoly of happiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>What, then, is this mysterious thing called
happiness, which apparently cannot be taken
away from some, yet which others vainly pursue
for a lifetime? I have already said that it
is something that has to be learned or to be
won. It is clear that having everything in the
world to make one happy does not always
bring happiness, and the reason is that there
is no real well-being without consciousness of
well-being. If one were heir to vast riches, yet
lived and died without knowing of his wealth,
it would have been just the same as to have
had no wealth. To have youth, health, love,
and opportunity, and not to know that one is
blest by and through these great gifts, is, perhaps,
not greatly different from having none
of them. So we see the importance of being
fully awake to the blessings we have. You
think, for example, that you enjoy and appreciate
your home, but if you should learn to-morrow
that you had lost it, you would probably
discover that you had not received nearly
as much happiness from it as you should have.
Perhaps you would even recall with remorse
that you had sometimes envied the fairer home
of some friend, and had allowed yourself to
grow quite unhappy over the matter. If those
you love best were suddenly to be taken from
you, would you then discover how small had
been your real appreciation of them? With a
deeper appreciation would be found a gratitude
constantly translating itself in terms of kindness,
patience, and unselfishness. Ask yourself,
then, whether you are sure you have derived
the happiness that should have been yours
from the blessings nearest you.</p>

<p class='c011'>Have we not learned in part the secret of
happiness? <em>Consciousness of our blessings, deep
gratitude for them</em>, is one of the chief sources of
happiness. And do we not see why we grow
happier as we grow older? Our losses may be
great,—are almost sure to be great,—but
how we learn to appreciate what we have left!
How trivialities sink into their place and the
great things of life loom large! Once the day
was overcast because of some fancied slight or
neglect, or the weather had upset some cherished
plan, or—but why go on with the list?
Since then greater troubles have come and a
new sense of proportion has been born within
us; a consciousness of our great wealth is ever
with us. This is one of the secure foundations
of happiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Do not wait for Experience to teach you
these things, for she keeps a dear school. Learn
from the experience of others. There is plenty
of justifiable sadness in the world, there is
plenty of real trouble. Those of us who are
not experiencing it owe it to those who are to
be cheerful, serene, and strong, that they may
lean on us and that we may help carry some
of their heavy burdens.</p>

<p class='c011'>Since it is entirely possible for life to grow
happier as it goes on, and since many people
find it exactly the reverse, what more can be
said by way of pointing out the right path?
And when should one seek this path? May
one wait until the years of unhappiness come?
<em>One may not wait.</em> The path may be choked
with weeds unless one’s feet find it now. As you
look forward into the years you have yet to
live, what saner question can you ask than
how you can find that inward happiness which
has for many proved a bulwark against all the
buffetings of fate?</p>

<p class='c011'>It would be hard to over-emphasize the part
<em>work</em> plays in making one happy. Idle people
are generally unhappy. Look forward, then,
to being busy, as long as you live. Find something
to do, somewhere, and throw your whole
self into your work. It need not be work that
is paid for with money, but something to occupy
your time and thoughts you must have.
You need to feel that by your endeavors you
are adding to the world’s welfare. Look forward
to getting a large share of your happiness
in <em>service</em> and you will not be disappointed.
Work is a panacea for most of the ills of life.
When a great sorrow comes, how shall one
endure it unless one has work to do?</p>

<p class='c011'>Another deep source of happiness is the
carrying of responsibility. It is good to develop
early in life the habit of solicitude for
others. Fortunate are we if there are those who
are in some way dependent upon us; it is good
for us to deny ourselves for their sake. Happy
is the girl who has younger brothers and sisters
needing her affectionate and watchful
care.</p>

<p class='c011'>Love must play a large part in every life.
In solitude we become narrow, we can never
discover ourselves. We need friends and the
stimulus of contact with our fellow men. We
must give and receive affection. The trouble
with most of us is that we think too much
about receiving and not enough about giving.
Here as everywhere it is more blessed to give
than to receive.</p>

<p class='c011'>For true happiness we need constantly increasing
knowledge. An ignorant life can
hardly be a happy life. We should be on terms
of closest friendship with books. Every one
should have some department or field of learning
in which he is steadily making conquests,
and this in addition to the reading of the best
literature. It may be music, or art, or a science,
or a language, or some other pursuit to which
one turns for recreation and inspiration. In
these days good instruction is obtained so easily
that intellectual stagnation is inexcusable. Indeed,
any one who is really in earnest can make
intellectual progress without instruction except
that which one gives himself. I knew a busy
lawyer who so mastered the subject of botany
through self-instruction that he became an
able writer and a recognized authority on the
subject. Many have mastered a foreign language
with the assistance only of books. What
a mistake it is to think that with the closing
of the school and college days one should cease
to be a student! We are never too old to begin
the serious study of some subject hitherto unknown
to us. Did not Julia Ward Howe begin
the study of Greek at an age when most people
only doze by the fire?</p>

<p class='c011'>I have mentioned as important sources of
happiness four things—work, responsibility,
love, knowledge. It remains to call attention
to three kinds, or perhaps three degrees, of
happiness. The lowest is merely pleasure or
a succession of pleasures. Pleasure depends
largely upon what we have, that is, upon external
things. It has no deep roots at life’s
center; yet it is good if we estimate it rightly
and recognize that it is not real happiness.
Beautiful clothes to wear, good things to eat
and drink, a fine house to live in—these things
all give pleasure, yet many have found happiness
without them. Some have had all of
these and yet have led discontented lives.
Parties, balls, social pleasures of every sort;
travel, money to spend according to one’s
whims; these have their place. Do they occupy
a large place in your life? Well and good; but
there is nothing about any of these worthy to
be ranked as happiness. You can easily imagine
yourself stripped of them all. Would you
then be miserable?</p>

<p class='c011'>Congenial companionship and congenial work
come nearer to making real happiness for most
of us. Indeed, there are few things upon which
the majority of people are so dependent. Yet
it would not be difficult to find those who
have been deprived of both, and have yet led
strong, serene, and useful lives.</p>

<p class='c011'>You have noticed that the sources of happiness
which I have named differ in that while
some can be taken away from us, others cannot.
It is difficult to conceive of any place or
time or circumstances under which we could
be deprived of the privilege of loving and serving.
Our feeling of obligation and responsibility
for others is one that should deepen with
years, and from this source we should learn to
derive more and more of our happiness. This
kind of happiness is very far removed from
what we ordinarily think of as pleasure; indeed,
it often involves suffering.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We can only have the highest happiness—such
as goes along with being a great
man—by having wide thoughts and much
feeling for the rest of the world as well as ourselves;
and this sort of happiness often brings
so much pain with it that we can only tell it
from pain by its being what we would choose
before everything else, because our souls see
it is good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the happiness of Lincoln, carrying
the burdens of his unhappy country on his
suffering heart; it was the happiness of the
noble army of martyrs of every age; it was
the happiness of Christ. He taught us to call
it blessedness. As you carefully study His life
and character, you will see that He was acquainted
with all three kinds of happiness. He
despised not pleasure. He was no ascetic, but
came eating and drinking. Great must have
been the enjoyment in nature of one who could
speak as He spake of the lily of the field that
outshone the splendor of Solomon, of the humble
sparrow unloved of men, but cared for by
the good All-Father, of the green blade bursting
through the dark soil, of the fields yellowing
for the harvest. He enjoyed mingling with His
fellow men and knew the joys of friendship. The
work which He had been given to do absorbed
Him and filled Him with constant joy. If He
had not been happy He could not have drawn
others to Him as He did, and above all, little
children would not have come unto Him. If
we sometimes have a different idea of Him, it
is because of the closing scenes of His life,
after He became a man of sorrows and acquainted
with grief.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet it was blessedness that Christ knew
best of all. The deeper joys were His; the joy
of self-forgetfulness and of self-sacrifice, and
the joy of knowing that He was in perfect
harmony with His Father’s will. Yet who
shall say that He was not happy? Would He
have exchanged His life of toil and hardship
and suffering for any other lot? We know that
He never sought another. His secret lies open
to the world, for He spoke of it over and over
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Life does not treat us all alike in the matter
of pleasure, and if that were the end and aim
of existence this would seem to be a very
unjust world. Life does not treat us with entire
impartiality even in the matter of happiness.
Though most of us are given sufficient material
to make life rich and full if we will, yet there
are lives that seem to be an exception to this
rule. But life treats us all alike in that if
pleasure is denied us and we have scant material
out of which to build happiness, we may
at least attain to blessedness. We may have
the joy of self-sacrifice, the privilege of living
for others, the glad consciousness of duty nobly
done, the power of spiritual growth, the blessedness
of knowing that our will is in harmony
with God’s will. These things the world does
not give and it cannot take away.</p>

  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c015'>XIV<br /> <br />AFTER GRADUATION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“There is a past which is gone forever, but
there is a future which is still our own.” Never
before or after is one likely to have such mingled
feelings of regret for the vanished past and
eagerness for the approaching future as at the
close of the school life. Sometimes it is difficult
to decide whether the note of sadness or of joy
is the dominant one.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the school days are seen to be rapidly
slipping away, the student recognizes, perhaps
for the first time, something of their real worth.
They have not been wholly free from troubles
and disappointments, though some time, by
contrast, it will seem that they have been so.
Even now, however, you know them to have
been days of happy freedom, of glad fellowship,
of joyous achievement. Your chief regret
in the future will be that you did not quite
understand how perfect they were. Now you
begin to see what older people mean when they
talk of “halcyon days.” Not that they were
the best days your life will know,—let no
one persuade you to that,—but they have a
quality all their own that can belong to no
other period of life. They will loom larger and
larger as they recede into the past, for you will
realize more and more fully how much was
then begun in you which will go on as long as
your soul shall endure.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are few who can approach the end
of school or college life without being made a
little serious by the thought that they are
moving on. “So our lives glide on,” says
George Eliot; “the river ends, we don’t know
where, the sea begins, and then there is no
more jumping ashore.” Perhaps it has come
to you with overwhelming suddenness that
the days of preparation for life are over and
that the life for which you have been preparing
is at hand. You seem always to have been in
a safe and sheltered harbor. Now you must
push out into the great stream of life, must
become your own pilot, must henceforth be
responsible for the conduct of the voyage. Are
you wise enough for such an undertaking?
Who is? Yet an all-wise Creator has ordained
that this way lies the only possibility of growth.
Responsibility is thrust upon us and we grow
able to carry responsibility.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When Duty whispers, lo! thou must.</div>
      <div class='line'>The youth replies, I can.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The realization of all these sober facts, coming
home to the young heart with sudden force,
often begets a mood of seriousness and of
peculiar responsiveness. It may be that one
has not always listened very attentively even
to words spoken in deepest earnestness. Life
is so full of absorbing interests that it is easy to
hear yet hear not. We sometimes forget what
an enormous amount of good advice is given to
young people and how difficult it would be to
follow all of it. Yet I have seldom known a
student in whom the combined circumstances
of graduation—those to which I have referred
and many more—did not produce an earnest
and responsive mood, a mood which welcomed
sincere and kindly advice. At such a time words
of counsel are likely to sink into the heart as
seeds into the upturned earth after a rain. Is
it for this reason that we call in the wisest and
most inspiring speaker we can find to say the
very last words to those whom we send forth,
conscious, as we always must be, how far short
our best efforts have fallen of our high intentions?</p>

<p class='c011'>There is in the heart of every young person
who has any serious thoughts a desire that life
may be lived worthily. Who can look forward
with any satisfaction to being a drone in the
world’s busy hive? Who can be content to
count only as a cipher? “Each of us,” says
one of our ex-Presidents, “unless he is contented
to be a slumberer on the earth’s surface,
must do his life-work with his whole heart.”
Does not this strike a responsive chord in each
one of us?</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a phrase current in these days which
began as slang, but which found so useful a
place it is not likely to disappear. It is the
phrase, “make good.” It is oftenest heard in
connection with young people after they have
left school or college for active life. Their anxious
friends inquire, “Will he make good?”
“Is she making good?” Unless I am mistaken
there is more or less turmoil and anxiety in the
minds of most young people—an anxiety seldom
admitted to others and not always to
themselves, lest they may not “make good.”
The greater one’s longing to be of use, the
greater, perhaps, the fear of inability to live
up to one’s high obligations. How can one be
sure of finding the opportunity to render the
service one is eager to render? All departments
of service seem already crowded; can it be that
the world needs more workers? One must be
peculiarly endowed with self-confidence who
feels no misgivings on this score. Yet timidity
never accomplished anything, and belief that
we shall succeed is the first essential of success.
Though the world presents an apparently solid
front to the would-be worker, it is astonishing
how quickly it makes a place for one who
shows the qualities of perseverance and pluck.
There is work for every one who is earnest
and willing. Put out of your mind, then, every
thought of failure, have faith in yourself and
your own powers, and believe that your part
in life will be a worthy one.</p>

<p class='c011'>We must remember, in the first place, that
what we are at any given time is only the
beginning of our real selves, that is, of our
realized selves. The self you seem to be is
not you any more than yourself of five years
ago was really you. We are constantly changing,
never completed. Little do you know the
power that may develop within you. To begin
somewhere, somehow, doing what your
hand or your brain finds to do and doing it
enthusiastically and well, is a sure guaranty of
that growth which begets larger opportunity.</p>

<p class='c011'>To discover that opportunity, however, that
vantage-point which determines future growth,
is, in the case of many young women, not so
easy as it seems. Few who are not brought
close to the problems of large numbers of young
women realize how much more difficult it is
for them than it is for their brothers to find,
immediately after graduation, conditions which
are conducive to earnest, purposeful, and
growing lives. Contrast a graduating class of
young women with a similar class of young
men. Look forward into the next few years
and note the differences that are likely to
exist in the conditions and circumstances of
their lives. In the majority of cases the young
man has already chosen his life-work and he
hastens eagerly to it. Every stimulus to endeavor
is furnished him. The world expects
him to give up all else, if necessary, for that
chosen work, and it is demanded of him that
he succeed. He knows the rich rewards which
come to the man who reaches the top of his
profession or business. He may go to any
part of the earth that will best suit his own
purpose. Though he be an only son, or even
an only child, he goes, and the world does not
disapprove. To give up a promising career
that loved ones might not be left lonely would
seem, to say the least, quixotic. Has not the
young man his own destiny to carve out?</p>

<p class='c011'>All this is probably right. I am not finding
fault with the world’s attitude toward its
young men. I am not intimating that there is
no difference between men and women, or that
it is right or desirable that the average young
woman should aspire to a “career.” I should
like, however, to point out some of the obstacles
that often lie in the way of her growth.
How frequent are the comments upon the apparently
aimless and purposeless life of some
young woman who once was eager for growth
and useful activity! I want to inquire what
the world has done to make her life purposeful.
Indeed, the probability is that if she has
desired to engage in some definite work that
she loved and believed worth while, a chorus
of voices has gone up in protest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not all girls meet the same problems after
graduation. In this respect there are to my
mind three distinct classes. First, there is the
girl who is well satisfied to settle down at
home and to whom after a brief period there
comes an early and a happy marriage. So far
as we are concerned here, her problems are
settled, and settled in an eminently satisfactory
way. To such a girl one only wants to give the
warning that to ensconce one’s self snugly in a
happy home with one’s loved ones and forget
the rest of the world is ignoble. There are too
many bad homes in the world that need your
touch, there are too many homeless people who
need your hospitality. While the first and best
service you can render is to create an ideal
home, yet that home should be shared. One
thing which all of us, from the greatest to the
least, can do is to work for the betterment of
the community in which we live. So long as
there are bad laws or unenforced good laws,
harmful sanitary conditions, wrong social influences,
we should prove our good citizenship
by making sacrifices for the public welfare.
The woman without a business or profession
is in a peculiarly advantageous position for
giving the service those with less time at their
disposal cannot render.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second class of girls I have in mind consists
of those who do not wish or need to settle
down at home with little or nothing to do, but
who crave a larger activity. I am not speaking
of those who are genuinely needed at home.
No girl with right instincts can be so cowardly
as to desert in their need—and for her own
happiness or supposed welfare—those to whom
she owes most. Yet the need for her often
seems to exist when it really does not. There is
no family that would not be the happier for the
presence of an affectionate and helpful daughter
in the home. Increase in the family happiness
alone, however, is not a sufficient excuse
for stifling the desires of an eager and aspiring
daughter. The family should make sure that
her highest welfare, as well as their own, is
being guarded. When the parents decided to
give that daughter an education, they took
an irrevocable step. Is it strange that now,
with all her mental faculties developed and her
heart awakened to the needs of humanity,
those things which once filled her life can do so
no longer? Parents who do not want to see in
their daughter the development of new interests
and new longings should not educate her.</p>

<p class='c011'>How often have I heard the plea that the
daughter was needed in the home when to
the outward observer this need was much
less than the daughter’s need of opportunity!
Those who take it upon themselves to deprive
a young woman of that form of growth, or of
service which she most desires, should not be
forgetful of her future. How many women have
I seen who had given up exclusively to their
parents the best years of their youth, letting
the time slip by when they might have acquired
proficiency in some special and satisfying work!
Death finally stepped in and removed the objects
of their love and the center of their life-interest,
leaving them alone, with empty hearts
and lives. Look about you and see how many
women you can count up who belong to this
class. I have often asked myself in such a case
what it was the family received from this woman
to justify the enormous sacrifice. I sometimes
wonder how parents ever dare to run the
risk of such a fate for a beloved daughter. The
woman who does not marry should have some
definite occupation as a permanent source of
happiness and growth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us assume, for a moment, that you are
one of the many young women who long for
some form of service that will exercise all your
higher powers and faculties. Let us suppose,
further, that you are free from those family
responsibilities which would debar you from
gratifying that longing. The craving for useful
activity is not something to be stifled. It is the
result of one of the greatest spiritual laws of
life—the law that action, progress, achievement
are the essentials of a happy and contented
life. The soul wearies of the most beautiful
surroundings when deprived of happy activity.
One of the supreme joys of life is the
joy of doing. To feel all one’s powers stretched
to the utmost, and to realize that through the
exercise of those powers one is making a real
contribution to the world’s welfare, is the
source of the deepest satisfaction the human
heart can know. Teas and balls and all the
pleasures of social intercourse have their place,
but you cannot live on them. They cannot
feed the sources of the soul’s power.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do something worth living for, worth dying
for. Do something to show that you have a
heart and a mind and a soul within you,” were
some of the ringing words of Dean Stanley.
Half a century ago the world’s emphatic disapproval
of the woman who engaged in any
activity outside of the home was enough to
clip the wings of all but the most daring. How
difficult it is for us to realize now the scorn
and contumely which were heaped upon noble
Florence Nightingale, when she announced
that she intended to become a nurse and to
establish training-schools where other young
women might study that self-sacrificing profession!
It was called unwomanly, degrading.</p>

<p class='c011'>The modern Florence Nightingale finds a
world eager to welcome her services, ready to
recompense her for them, and glad to honor
her. The young woman of to-day finds little
in the world’s attitude to debar her from entering
upon any form of service which attracts
her. Thus have our ideas regarding women
and their rights and privileges progressed in
the last fifty or sixty years. We recognize that
in some respects men and women are not as
different as we once thought. The craving for
self-realization and the joy of achievement are
neither distinctly masculine nor distinctly feminine.
They are simply human.</p>

<p class='c011'>Find, then, an opening somewhere. If you
cannot secure the precise thing you want to
do, take what you can secure and make a success
of it. Learn to do something well, and
if possible let it be something for which the
world is glad to compensate you. Mrs. Palmer
believed that every girl, rich or poor, should
acquire the ability to earn a living for herself
and others in case of need. She insisted upon
“the importance of giving every girl, no matter
what her present circumstances, a special
training in some one thing by which she can render
society service, not amateur, but of an expert
sort, and service, too, for which it will be
willing to pay a price.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The third girl whom I have in mind is the
one whose presence in the home is indispensable,
who must put out of mind all forms of
remunerative labor, and, therefore, must find
her chief success and happiness in ministering
to the needs of loved ones. It may be that
the mother upon whom you once leaned so
heavily must now lean on you. Or perhaps
the mother is no longer in the home and you
have the high privilege of taking her place.
What better opportunity for growth than this
could any girl ask? We cannot choose our
duties. Life makes them for us, and if we shirk
them, there is no happiness and no success for
us. If you make it the rule of your life to
escape from what is burdensome and to choose
the path of pleasure, happiness will not come
anyway and you will lack the satisfaction of
knowing that you have done right.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet even the girl who remains in her own
home can usually spare time and strength for
some other service, and it is best that she
should. Her horizon is thereby widened, new
friends that are worth while are made, and she
is given an opportunity for growth in a different
direction from that supplied by home
duties. I have known many girls who have
been remarkably successful in combining the
two—work inside and work outside of the
home. Living in your own home and helping
to make it a center of attraction, hospitality,
and fine influence, you are in a peculiarly fortunate
position for rendering a form of service
which is needed in every city and every village
throughout the country. Many young women
so situated have done efficient work in connection
with the Young Women’s Christian
Association or with girls’ clubs. Church work
is a field that is open to all. In women’s clubs,
literary clubs, and organizations for civic betterment
many find avenues for useful activity,
while others find satisfaction in charity work,
hospital work, or other forms of benevolent
service.</p>

<p class='c011'>The young woman who seeks to give her service
is often surprised at her inability to find just
what she likes or to perform it well when found.
This is because the untrained worker is always
at a disadvantage. It is far easier to fill a humble
position on a small salary, where the duties
are definite and must be performed whether
one will or no. In such a position, if one is
earnest and industrious, one must necessarily
grow. With all forms of unpaid labor, the
danger is lest one may not take one’s work
seriously enough, and may not hold one’s self
closely to responsibility. Any trained worker
who depends upon volunteer assistants, as is
often the case in girls’ clubs and the Young
Women’s Christian Association, can tell you
how rarely she finds an unpaid helper upon
whom she can depend. If you select some such
work, even though you can give it but a few
hours a week, and if you see fit to throw yourself
as enthusiastically and earnestly into it as
if you were taking a position as teacher or librarian
or stenographer, there can be no doubt
that you will find in it happiness and success.</p>

<p class='c011'>When you think of the thousands of homeless
women wage-earners, you can realize how
thankful every girl should be who has a good
home. Surely there is, for most girls, some
midway ground between starting out as independently
as their brothers do, to carve out
their own career, and stagnating at home. One
of the chief results of the higher education
of women should be that they do much
uncompensated labor which is now done badly or
not at all. There is a rich field for women of
the well-to-do classes who do not need to earn
their living, and this field is growing larger
every year. There is little excuse for idle hands
or empty hearts or purposeless lives. Some
have eyes to see, yet they see not. If you
belong to the class of girls to which I have
referred, ask yourself what some more eager
and purposeful person in your place would find
to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a splendid thing to live in the twentieth
century. The young people who enter life
these days are going out into the busiest world
there has ever been. Never has the need of
strong, capable, intelligent women been so
great. The bond of fellowship which unites
each one of us to the whole human race is to
be recognized in the future as never before.
Women of the future are to demand of themselves
almost all that was demanded of the
women of the past and much more, and they
will be equal to the demands because of more
highly trained intelligence.</p>

<p class='c011'>The greatest temptation of the average
young woman to-day in our better classes of
society is to listen too willingly to the winsome
voice of pleasure. I do not mean wrong kinds
of pleasure; I mean those that are in themselves
harmless. Nor do I mean that it is
desirable that youth should lose any of its
natural joy and gladness. The world can ill
spare any of that. But the continual giving-up
of ourselves to things that leave no lasting
impress for good, and that do not lift us
above ourselves, robs us of time and strength
that should be given to the main business of
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The great wrong in modern life,” says
Professor James, “is a desperate struggle for a
four-cornered contentment. Teach those who
come your way that it is not a formal peace
which is worth having in life; it is the deep
consciousness of power to create and progress,
to create <em>new</em> in life, and to live for wide, free,
unsullied things, which never fail and never
can decay.”</p>
